<h2 class="eee">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>One little picture in this book, the Magic Locket,
at <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, was drawn by &lsquo;Miss Alice Havers.&rsquo; I did
not state this on the title-page, since it seemed only
due, to the artist of all these (to my mind) <i>wonderful</i>
pictures, that his name should stand there alone.</p>
<p class="tb">The descriptions, at pp. <a href="#Page_386">386</a>, <a href="#Page_387">387</a>, of Sunday as
spent by children of the last generation, are quoted
<i>verbatim</i> from a speech made to me by a child-friend
and a letter written to me by a lady-friend.</p>
<p class="tb">The Chapters, headed &lsquo;Fairy Sylvie&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bruno&rsquo;s
Revenge,&rsquo; are a reprint, with a few alterations, of a
little fairy-tale which I wrote in the year 1867, at the
request of the late Mrs. Gatty, for &lsquo;Aunt Judy&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rsquo; which she was then editing.</p>
<p>It was in 1874, I believe, that the idea first occurred
to me of making it the nucleus of a longer story. As
the years went on, I jotted down, at odd moments,
all sorts of odd ideas, and fragments of dialogue, that
occurred to me&mdash;who knows how?&mdash;with a transitory
suddenness that left me no choice but either
to record them then and there, or to abandon them
to oblivion. Sometimes one could trace to their
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
source these random flashes of thought&mdash;as being
suggested by the book one was reading, or struck
out from the &lsquo;flint&rsquo; of one&rsquo;s own mind by the &lsquo;steel&rsquo;
of a friend&rsquo;s chance remark&mdash;but they had also a
way of their own, of occurring, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of nothing&mdash;specimens
of that hopelessly illogical phenomenon,
&lsquo;an effect without a cause.&rsquo; Such, for example, was
the last line of &lsquo;The Hunting of the Snark,&rsquo; which
came into my head (as I have already related in
&lsquo;The Theatre&rsquo; for April, 1887) quite suddenly, during
a solitary walk: and such, again, have been passages
which occurred in <i>dreams</i>, and which I cannot trace
to any antecedent cause whatever. There are at
least <i>two</i> instances of such dream-suggestions in
this book&mdash;one, my Lady&rsquo;s remark, &lsquo;it often runs
in families, just as a love for pastry does&rsquo;, at <a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>;
the other, Eric Lindon&rsquo;s <i>badinage</i> about having been
in domestic service, at <a href="#Page_332">p. 332</a>.</p>
<p>And thus it came to pass that I found myself at
last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litterature&mdash;if
the reader will kindly excuse the spelling&mdash;which
only needed stringing together, upon the
thread of a consecutive story, to constitute the book
I hoped to write. Only! The task, at first, seemed
absolutely hopeless, and gave me a far clearer idea,
than I ever had before, of the meaning of the word
&lsquo;chaos&rsquo;: and I think it must have been ten years, or
more, before I had succeeded in classifying these
odds-and-ends sufficiently to see what sort of a story
they indicated: for the story had to grow out of the
incidents, not the incidents out of the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</div>
<p>I am telling all this, in no spirit of egoism, but
because I really believe that some of my readers will
be interested in these details of the &lsquo;genesis&rsquo; of a
book, which looks so simple and straight-forward a
matter, when completed, that they might suppose it
to have been written straight off, page by page,
as one would write a letter, beginning at the beginning
and ending at the end.</p>
<p>It is, no doubt, <i>possible</i> to write a story in that
way: and, if it be not vanity to say so, I believe
that I could, myself,&mdash;if I were in the unfortunate
position (for I do hold it to be a real misfortune) of
being obliged to produce a given amount of fiction
in a given time,&mdash;that I could &lsquo;fulfil my task,&rsquo; and
produce my &lsquo;tale of bricks,&rsquo; as other slaves have
done. One thing, at any rate, I could guarantee as
to the story so produced&mdash;that it should be utterly
commonplace, should contain no new ideas whatever,
and should be very very weary reading!</p>
<p>This species of literature has received the very
appropriate name of &lsquo;padding&rsquo;&mdash;which might fitly
be defined as &lsquo;that which all can write and none can
read.&rsquo; That the present volume contains <i>no</i> such
writing I dare not avow: sometimes, in order to
bring a picture into its proper place, it has been
necessary to eke out a page with two or three extra
lines: but I can honestly say I have put in no more
than I was absolutely compelled to do.</p>
<p>My readers may perhaps like to amuse themselves
by trying to detect, in a given passage, the one piece
of &lsquo;padding&rsquo; it contains. While arranging the &lsquo;slips&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
into pages, I found that the passage, which now extends
from the top of <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a> to the middle of <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>, was
3 lines too short. I supplied the deficiency, not by
interpolating a word here and a word there, but by
writing in 3 consecutive lines. Now can my readers
guess <i>which</i> they are?</p>
<p>A harder puzzle&mdash;if a harder be desired&mdash;would
be to determine, as to the Gardener&rsquo;s Song, in <i>which</i>
cases (if any) the stanza was adapted to the surrounding
text, and in <i>which</i> (if any) the text was adapted
to the stanza.</p>
<p class="tb">Perhaps the hardest thing in all literature&mdash;at
least <i>I</i> have found it so: by no voluntary effort can
I accomplish it: I have to take it as it comes&mdash;is
to write anything <i>original</i>. And perhaps the easiest
is, when once an original line has been struck out, to
follow it up, and to write any amount more to the
same tune. I do not know if &lsquo;Alice in Wonderland&rsquo;
was an <i>original</i> story&mdash;I was, at least, no <i>conscious</i>
imitator in writing it&mdash;but I do know that, since it
came out, something like a dozen story-books have
appeared, on identically the same pattern. The path
I timidly explored&mdash;believing myself to be &lsquo;the first
that ever burst into that silent sea&rsquo;&mdash;is now a beaten
high-road: all the way-side flowers have long ago
been trampled into the dust: and it would be courting
disaster for me to attempt that style again.</p>
<p>Hence it is that, in &lsquo;Sylvie and Bruno,&rsquo; I have
striven&mdash;with I know not what success&mdash;to strike
out yet another new path: be it bad or good, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
the best I can do. It is written, not for money, and
not for fame, but in the hope of supplying, for the
children whom I love, some thoughts that may suit
those hours of innocent merriment which are the very
life of Childhood; and also in the hope of suggesting,
to them and to others, some thoughts that may
prove, I would fain hope, not wholly out of harmony
with the graver cadences of Life.</p>
<p class="tb">If I have not already exhausted the patience of
my readers, I would like to seize this opportunity&mdash;perhaps
the last I shall have of addressing so many
friends at once&mdash;of putting on record some ideas
that have occurred to me, as to books desirable to
be written&mdash;which I should much like to <i>attempt</i>,
but may not ever have the time or power to carry
through&mdash;in the hope that, if <i>I</i> should fail (and the
years are gliding away <i>very</i> fast) to finish the task
I have set myself, other hands may take it up.</p>
<p class="tb">First, a Child&rsquo;s Bible. The only real <i>essentials</i> of
this would be, carefully selected passages, suitable for
a child&rsquo;s reading, and pictures. One principle of selection,
which I would adopt, would be that Religion
should be put before a child as a revelation of <i>love</i>&mdash;no need
to pain and puzzle the young mind with
the history of crime and punishment. (On such a
principle I should, for example, omit the history of
the Flood.) The supplying of the pictures would
involve no great difficulty: no new ones would be
needed: hundreds of excellent pictures already exist,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
the copyright of which has long ago expired, and
which simply need photo-zincography, or some similar
process, for their successful reproduction. The book
should be handy in size&mdash;with a pretty attractive-looking
cover&mdash;in a clear legible type&mdash;and, above
all, with abundance of pictures, pictures, pictures!</p>
<p class="tb">Secondly, a book of pieces selected from the Bible&mdash;not
single texts, but passages of from 10 to 20
verses each&mdash;to be committed to memory. Such
passages would be found useful, to repeat to one&rsquo;s-self
and to ponder over, on many occasions when
reading is difficult, if not impossible: for instance,
when lying awake at night&mdash;on a railway-journey&mdash;when
taking a solitary walk&mdash;in old age, when
eye-sight is failing or wholly lost&mdash;and, best of all,
when illness, while incapacitating us for reading or
any other occupation, condemns us to lie awake
through many weary silent hours: at such a time
how keenly one may realise the truth of David&rsquo;s
rapturous cry &lsquo;<i>O how sweet are thy words unto my
throat: yea, sweeter than honey unto my mouth!</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have said &lsquo;passages,&rsquo; rather than single texts,
because we have no means of <i>recalling</i> single texts:
memory needs <i>links</i>, and here are none: one may
have a hundred texts stored in the memory, and not
be able to recall, at will, more than half-a-dozen&mdash;and
those by mere chance: whereas, once get hold of
any portion of a <i>chapter</i> that has been committed to
memory, and the whole can be recovered: all hangs
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</div>
<p class="tb">Thirdly, a collection of passages, both prose and
verse, from books other than the Bible. There is not
perhaps much, in what is called &lsquo;un-inspired&rsquo; literature
(a misnomer, I hold: if Shakespeare was not
inspired, one may well doubt if any man ever was),
that will bear the process of being pondered over, a
hundred times: still there <i>are</i> such passages&mdash;enough,
I think, to make a goodly store for the memory.</p>
<p>These two books&mdash;of sacred, and secular, passages
for memory&mdash;will serve other good purposes besides
merely occupying vacant hours: they will help to keep
at bay many anxious thoughts, worrying thoughts,
uncharitable thoughts, unholy thoughts. Let me say
this, in better words than my own, by copying a
passage from that most interesting book, Robertson&rsquo;s
Lectures on the Epistles to the Corinthians, Lecture
<span class="small">XLIX</span>. &ldquo;If a man finds himself haunted by evil
desires and unholy images, which will generally be at
periodical hours, let him commit to memory passages
of Scripture, or passages from the best writers in verse
or prose. Let him store his mind with these, as safe-guards
to repeat when he lies awake in some restless
night, or when despairing imaginations, or gloomy,
suicidal thoughts, beset him. Let these be to him the
sword, turning everywhere to keep the way of the
Garden of Life from the intrusion of profaner
footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Fourthly, a &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; for girls: that is, an
edition in which everything, not suitable for the perusal
of girls of (say) from 10 to 17, should be omitted. Few
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
children under 10 would be likely to understand or
enjoy the greatest of poets: and those, who have
passed out of girlhood, may safely be left to read
Shakespeare, in any edition, &lsquo;expurgated&rsquo; or not, that
they may prefer: but it seems a pity that so many
children, in the intermediate stage, should be debarred
from a great pleasure for want of an edition suitable
to them. Neither Bowdler&rsquo;s, Chambers&rsquo;s, Brandram&rsquo;s,
nor Cundell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Boudoir&rsquo; Shakespeare, seems to me to
meet the want: they are not sufficiently &lsquo;expurgated.&rsquo;
Bowdler&rsquo;s is the most extraordinary of all: looking
through it, I am filled with a deep sense of wonder,
considering what he has left in, that he should have
cut <i>anything</i> out! Besides relentlessly erasing all
that is unsuitable on the score of reverence or decency,
I should be inclined to omit also all that seems too
difficult, or not likely to interest young readers. The
resulting book might be slightly fragmentary: but it
would be a real treasure to all British maidens who
have any taste for poetry.</p>
<p class="tb">If it be needful to apologize to any one for the
new departure I have taken in this story&mdash;by introducing,
along with what will, I hope, prove to be
acceptable nonsense for children, some of the graver
thoughts of human life&mdash;it must be to one who
has learned the Art of keeping such thoughts wholly
at a distance in hours of mirth and careless ease. To
him such a mixture will seem, no doubt, ill-judged
and repulsive. And that such an Art <i>exists</i> I do not
dispute: with youth, good health, and sufficient money,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
it seems quite possible to lead, for years together, a
life of unmixed gaiety&mdash;with the exception of one
solemn fact, with which we are liable to be confronted
at <i>any</i> moment, even in the midst of the most brilliant
company or the most sparkling entertainment. A
man may fix his own times for admitting serious
thought, for attending public worship, for prayer, for
reading the Bible: all such matters he can defer to
that &lsquo;convenient season&rsquo;, which is so apt never to
occur at all: but he cannot defer, for one single
moment, the necessity of attending to a message,
which may come before he has finished reading this
page, &lsquo;<i>this night shall thy soul be required of thee</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ever-present sense of this grim possibility has
been, in all ages,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
an incubus that men have striven
to shake off. Few more interesting subjects of enquiry
could be found, by a student of history, than
the various weapons that have been used against this
shadowy foe. Saddest of all must have been the
thoughts of those who saw indeed an <i>existence</i> beyond
the grave, but an existence far more terrible than
annihilation&mdash;an existence as filmy, impalpable, all
but invisible spectres, drifting about, through endless
ages, in a world of shadows, with nothing to do, nothing
to hope for, nothing to love! In the midst of the
gay verses of that genial &lsquo;bon vivant&rsquo; Horace, there
stands one dreary word whose utter sadness goes to
<span class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
one&rsquo;s heart. It is the word &lsquo;<i>exilium</i>&rsquo; in the well-known
passage</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium</p>
<p class="t0">Versatur urn&acirc; serius ocius</p>
<p class="t">Sors exitura et nos in &aelig;ternum</p>
<p class="t2">Exilium impositura cymb&aelig;.</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, to him this present life&mdash;spite of all its
weariness and all its sorrow&mdash;was the only life worth
having: all else was &lsquo;exile&rsquo;! Does it not seem almost
incredible that one, holding such a creed, should ever
have smiled?</p>
<p>And many in this day, I fear, even though believing
in an existence beyond the grave far more real than
Horace ever dreamed of, yet regard it as a sort of
&lsquo;exile&rsquo; from all the joys of life, and so adopt Horace&rsquo;s
theory, and say &lsquo;let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We go to entertainments, such as the theatre&mdash;I
say &lsquo;we&rsquo;, for <i>I</i> also go to the play, whenever I get a
chance of seeing a really good one&mdash;and keep at arm&rsquo;s
length, if possible, the thought that we may not return
alive. Yet how do you know&mdash;dear friend, whose
patience has carried you through this garrulous preface&mdash;that
it may not be <i>your</i> lot, when mirth is fastest
and most furious, to feel the sharp pang, or the deadly
faintness, which heralds the final crisis&mdash;to see, with
vague wonder, anxious friends bending over you&mdash;to
hear their troubled whispers&mdash;perhaps yourself to
shape the question, with trembling lips, &ldquo;Is it
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
serious?&rdquo;, and to be told &ldquo;Yes: the end is near&rdquo;
(and oh, how different all Life will look when those
words are said!)&mdash;how do you know, I say, that all
this may not happen to <i>you</i>, this night?</p>
<p>And <i>dare</i> you, knowing this, say to yourself &ldquo;Well,
perhaps it <i>is</i> an immoral play: perhaps the situations
<i>are</i> a little too &lsquo;risky&rsquo;, the dialogue a little too strong,
the &lsquo;business&rsquo; a little too suggestive. I don&rsquo;t say
that conscience is <i>quite</i> easy: but the piece is so
clever, I must see it this once! I&rsquo;ll begin a stricter
life to-morrow.&rdquo; <i>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow!</i></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Sorrow for sin God&rsquo;s judgement stays!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Against God&rsquo;s Spirit he lies; quite stops</p>
<p class="t0">Mercy with insult; dares, and drops,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a scorch&rsquo;d fly, that spins in vain</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the axis of its pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl,</p>
<p class="t0">Blind and forgot, from fall to fall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Let me pause for a moment to say that I believe
this thought, of the possibility of death&mdash;if calmly
realised, and steadily faced&mdash;would be one of the
best possible tests as to our going to any scene of
amusement being right or wrong. If the thought of
sudden death acquires, for <i>you</i>, a special horror when
imagined as happening in a <i>theatre</i>, then be very
sure the theatre is harmful for <i>you</i>, however
harmless it may be for others; and that <i>you</i> are
<span class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
incurring a deadly peril in going. Be sure the
safest rule is that we should not dare to <i>live</i> in any
scene in which we dare not <i>die</i>.</p>
<p>But, once realise what the true object <i>is</i> in life&mdash;that
it is <i>not</i> pleasure, <i>not</i> knowledge, <i>not</i> even fame
itself, &lsquo;that last infirmity of noble minds&rsquo;&mdash;but
that it <i>is</i> the development of <i>character</i>, the rising to
a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of
the perfect <i>Man</i>&mdash;and then, so long as we feel that
this is going on, and will (we trust) go on for evermore,
death has for us no terror; it is not a shadow,
but a light; not an end, but a beginning!</p>
<p class="tb">One other matter may perhaps seem to call for
apology&mdash;that I should have treated with such
entire want of sympathy the British passion for
&lsquo;Sport&rsquo;, which no doubt has been in by-gone days,
and is still, in some forms of it, an excellent school
for hardihood and for coolness in moments of danger.
But I am not entirely without sympathy for <i>genuine</i>
&lsquo;Sport&rsquo;: I can heartily admire the courage of the
man who, with severe bodily toil, and at the risk of
his life, hunts down some &lsquo;man-eating&rsquo; tiger: and I
can heartily sympathize with him when he exults in the
glorious excitement of the chase and the hand-to-hand
struggle with the monster brought to bay. But
I can but look with deep wonder and sorrow on the
hunter who, at his ease and in safety, can find pleasure
in what involves, for some defenceless creature,
wild terror and a death of agony: deeper, if the
hunter be one who has pledged himself to preach
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
to men the Religion of universal Love: deepest
of all, if it be one of those &lsquo;<i>tender and delicate</i>&rsquo;
beings, whose very name serves as a symbol of Love&mdash;&lsquo;<i>thy
love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
women</i>&rsquo;&mdash;whose mission here is surely to help and
comfort all that are in pain or sorrow!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Farewell, farewell! but this I tell</p>
<p class="t">To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!</p>
<p class="t0">He prayeth well, who loveth well</p>
<p class="t">Both man and bird and beast.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

<h1 title="">SYLVIE AND BRUNO.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">LESS BREAD! MORE TAXES!</span></h2>
<p>&mdash;and then all the people cheered again, and
one man, who was more excited than the rest,
flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as
well as I could make out) &ldquo;Who roar for the
Sub-Warden?&rdquo; <i>Everybody</i> roared, but whether
it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not
clearly appear: some were shouting &ldquo;Bread!&rdquo;
and some &ldquo;Taxes!&rdquo;, but no one seemed to
know what it was they really wanted.</p>
<p>All this I saw from the open window of
the Warden&rsquo;s breakfast-saloon, looking across
the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor, who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
sprung to his feet the moment the shouting
began, almost as if he had been expecting it,
and had rushed to the window which commanded
the best view of the market-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>can</i> it all mean?&rdquo; he kept repeating
to himself, as, with his hands clasped behind
him, and his gown floating in the air, he paced
rapidly up and down the room. &ldquo;I never
heard such shouting before&mdash;and at this time
of the morning, too! And with such unanimity!
Doesn&rsquo;t it strike <i>you</i> as very remarkable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I represented, modestly, that to <i>my</i> ears it
appeared that they were shouting for different
things, but the Chancellor would not listen to
my suggestion for a moment. &ldquo;They all shout
the same words, I assure you!&rdquo; he said: then,
leaning well out of the window, he whispered
to a man who was standing close underneath,
&ldquo;Keep &rsquo;em together, ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you? The Warden
will be here directly. Give &rsquo;em the signal for
the march up!&rdquo; All this was evidently not
meant for <i>my</i> ears, but I could scarcely help
hearing it, considering that my chin was almost
on the Chancellor&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" alt="THE MARCH-UP" width="500" height="593" />
<p class="center small">THE MARCH-UP</p>
</div>
<p>The &lsquo;march up&rsquo; was a very curious sight:
a straggling procession of men, marching two
and two, began from the other side of the
market-place, and advanced in an irregular
zig-zag fashion towards the Palace, wildly tacking
from side to side, like a sailing vessel
making way against an unfavourable wind&mdash;so
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
that the head of the procession was often
further from us at the end of one tack than it
had been at the end of the previous one.</p>
<p>Yet it was evident that all was being done
under orders, for I noticed that all eyes were
fixed on the man who stood just under the
window, and to whom the Chancellor was continually
whispering. This man held his hat in
one hand and a little green flag in the other:
whenever he waved the flag the procession
advanced a little nearer, when he dipped it they
sidled a little farther off, and whenever he
waved his hat they all raised a hoarse cheer.
&ldquo;Hoo-roah!&rdquo; they cried, carefully keeping time
with the hat as it bobbed up and down.
&ldquo;Hoo-roah! Noo! Consti! Tooshun! Less!
Bread! More! Taxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, that&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; the Chancellor
whispered. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em rest a bit till I give you
the word. He&rsquo;s not here yet!&rdquo; But at this
moment the great folding-doors of the saloon
were flung open, and he turned with a guilty
start to receive His High Excellency. However
it was only Bruno, and the Chancellor
gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; said the little fellow, addressing
the remark, in a general sort of way, to the
Chancellor and the waiters. &ldquo;Doos oo know
where Sylvie is? I&rsquo;s looking for Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with the Warden, I believe, y&rsquo;reince!&rdquo;
the Chancellor replied with a low bow. There
was, no doubt, a certain amount of absurdity in
applying this title (which, as of course you see
without my telling you, was nothing but &lsquo;your
Royal Highness&rsquo; condensed into one syllable)
to a small creature whose father was merely the
Warden of Outland: still, large excuse must
be made for a man who had passed several
years at the Court of Fairyland, and had there
acquired the almost impossible art of pronouncing
five syllables as one.</p>
<p>But the bow was lost upon Bruno, who had
run out of the room, even while the great feat
of The Unpronounceable Monosyllable was
being triumphantly performed.</p>
<p>Just then, a single voice in the distance was
understood to shout &ldquo;A speech from the
Chancellor!&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly, my friends!&rdquo; the Chancellor
replied with extraordinary promptitude.
&ldquo;You shall have a speech!&rdquo; Here one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
waiters, who had been for some minutes busy
making a queer-looking mixture of egg and
sherry, respectfully presented it on a large
silver salver. The Chancellor took it haughtily,
drank it off thoughtfully, smiled benevolently
on the happy waiter as he set down the empty
glass, and began. To the best of my recollection
this is what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem! Ahem! Ahem! Fellow-sufferers, or
rather suffering fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call &rsquo;em
names!&rdquo; muttered the man under the window.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say <i>felons</i>!&rdquo; the Chancellor
explained.) &ldquo;You may be sure that I always
sympa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;&rsquo;Ear, &rsquo;ear!&rdquo; shouted the crowd,
so loudly as quite to drown the orator&rsquo;s thin
squeaky voice) &ldquo;&mdash;that I always sympa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he repeated. (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t simper quite so much!&rdquo;
said the man under the window. &ldquo;It makes
yer look a hidiot!&rdquo; And, all this time, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ear,
&rsquo;ear!&rdquo; went rumbling round the market-place,
like a peal of thunder.) &ldquo;That I always <i>sympathise</i>!&rdquo;
yelled the Chancellor, the first moment
there was silence. &ldquo;But your <i>true</i> friend
is the <i>Sub-Warden</i>! Day and night he is
brooding on your wrongs&mdash;I should say your
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
<i>rights</i>&mdash;that is to say your <i>wrongs</i>&mdash;no, I
mean your <i>rights</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk no more!&rdquo;
growled the man under the window. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
making a mess of it!&rdquo;) At this moment the
Sub-Warden entered the saloon. He was a
thin man, with a mean and crafty face, and a
greenish-yellow complexion; and he crossed the
room very slowly, looking suspiciously about
him as if he thought there might be a savage
dog hidden somewhere. &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; he cried,
patting the Chancellor on the back. &ldquo;You did
that speech very well indeed. Why, you&rsquo;re a
born orator, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; the Chancellor replied,
modestly, with downcast eyes. &ldquo;Most orators
are <i>born</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sub-Warden thoughtfully rubbed his
chin. &ldquo;Why, so they are!&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I
never considered it in that light. Still, you
did it very well. A word in your ear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of their conversation was all in
whispers: so, as I could hear no more, I
thought I would go and find Bruno.</p>
<p>I found the little fellow standing in the
passage, and being addressed by one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
men in livery, who stood before him, nearly
bent double from extreme respectfulness, with
his hands hanging in front of him like the fins
of a fish. &ldquo;His High Excellency,&rdquo; this respectful
man was saying, &ldquo;is in his Study,
y&rsquo;reince!&rdquo; (He didn&rsquo;t pronounce this quite
so well as the Chancellor.) Thither Bruno
trotted, and I thought it well to follow him.</p>
<p>The Warden, a tall dignified man with a
grave but very pleasant face, was seated before
a writing-table, which was covered with papers,
and holding on his knee one of the sweetest and
loveliest little maidens it has ever been my lot
to see. She looked four or five years older
than Bruno, but she had the same rosy cheeks
and sparkling eyes, and the same wealth of
curly brown hair. Her eager smiling face was
turned upwards towards her father&rsquo;s, and it
was a pretty sight to see the mutual love with
which the two faces&mdash;one in the Spring of
Life, the other in its late Autumn&mdash;were
gazing on each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ve never seen him,&rdquo; the old man
was saying: &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t, you know, he&rsquo;s
been away so long&mdash;traveling from land to
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
land, and seeking for health, more years than
you&rsquo;ve been alive, little Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Bruno climbed upon his other knee, and
a good deal of kissing, on a rather complicated
system, was the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He only came back last night,&rdquo; said the
Warden, when the kissing was over: &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
been traveling post-haste, for the last thousand
miles or so, in order to be here on Sylvie&rsquo;s
birthday. But he&rsquo;s a very early riser, and I
dare say he&rsquo;s in the Library already. Come
with me and see him. He&rsquo;s always kind to
children. You&rsquo;ll be sure to like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the Other Professor come too?&rdquo;
Bruno asked in an awe-struck voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they arrived together. The Other
Professor is&mdash;well, you won&rsquo;t like him quite
so much, perhaps. He&rsquo;s a little more <i>dreamy</i>,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wiss <i>Sylvie</i> was a little more dreamy,&rdquo;
said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean, Bruno?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>Bruno went on addressing his father. &ldquo;She
says she <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>, oo know. But I thinks it isn&rsquo;t
<i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>, it&rsquo;s <i>wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Says she <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> dream!&rdquo; the puzzled
Warden repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>do</i> say it,&rdquo; Bruno persisted. &ldquo;When
I says to her &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s stop lessons!&rsquo;, she says
&lsquo;Oh, I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>dream</i> of letting oo stop yet!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always wants to stop lessons,&rdquo; Sylvie
explained, &ldquo;five minutes after we begin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes&rsquo; lessons a day!&rdquo; said the
Warden. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t learn much at <i>that</i>
rate, little man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what Sylvie says,&rdquo; Bruno rejoined.
&ldquo;She says I <i>wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> learn my lessons.
And I tells her, over and over, I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> learn
&rsquo;em. And what doos oo think she says? She
says &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>, it&rsquo;s <i>wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see the Professor,&rdquo; the Warden
said, wisely avoiding further discussion. The
children got down off his knees, each secured
a hand, and the happy trio set off for the
Library&mdash;followed by me. I had come to the
conclusion by this time that none of the party
(except, for a few moments, the Lord Chancellor)
was in the least able to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; Sylvie asked,
walking with a little extra sedateness, by way
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of example to Bruno at the other side, who
never ceased jumping up and down.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="center small">VISITING THE PROFESSOR</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>was</i> the matter&mdash;but I hope he&rsquo;s all
right now&mdash;was lumbago, and rheumatism, and
that kind of thing. He&rsquo;s been curing <i>himself</i>,
you know: he&rsquo;s a very learned doctor. Why,
he&rsquo;s actually <i>invented</i> three new diseases, besides
a new way of breaking your collar-bone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a nice way?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hum, not <i>very</i>,&rdquo; the Warden said, as
we entered the Library. &ldquo;And here <i>is</i> the
Professor. Good morning, Professor! Hope
you&rsquo;re quite rested after your journey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A jolly-looking, fat little man, in a flowery
dressing-gown, with a large book under each
arm, came trotting in at the other end of the
room, and was going straight across without
taking any notice of the children. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking
for Vol. Three,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you happen
to have seen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see my <i>children</i>, Professor!&rdquo;
the Warden exclaimed, taking him by the
shoulders and turning him round to face them.</p>
<p>The Professor laughed violently: then he
gazed at them through his great spectacles, for
a minute or two, without speaking.</p>
<p>At last he addressed Bruno. &ldquo;I hope you
have had a good night, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked puzzled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s had the same
night <i>oo&rsquo;ve</i> had,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
been <i>one</i> night since yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Professor&rsquo;s turn to look puzzled
now. He took off his spectacles, and rubbed
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
them with his hankerchief. Then he gazed at
them again. Then he turned to the Warden.
&ldquo;Are they bound?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bruno, who thought
himself quite able to answer <i>this</i> question.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head sadly. &ldquo;Not
even half-bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>would</i> we be half-bound?&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not prisoners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Professor had forgotten all about
them by this time, and was speaking to the
Warden again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad to hear,&rdquo; he
was saying, &ldquo;that the Barometer&rsquo;s beginning
to move&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, which way?&rdquo; said the Warden&mdash;adding
to the children, &ldquo;Not that <i>I</i> care, you
know. Only <i>he</i> thinks it affects the weather.
He&rsquo;s a wonderfully clever man, you know.
Sometimes he says things that only the Other
Professor can understand. Sometimes he says
things that <i>nobody</i> can understand! Which
way is it, Professor? Up or down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither!&rdquo; said the Professor, gently clapping
his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going sideways&mdash;if I
may so express myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what kind of weather does <i>that</i> produce?&rdquo;
said the Warden. &ldquo;Listen, children!
Now you&rsquo;ll hear something worth knowing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horizontal weather,&rdquo; said the Professor,
and made straight for the door, very nearly
trampling on Bruno, who had only just time to
get out of his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> he learned?&rdquo; the Warden said, looking
after him with admiring eyes. &ldquo;Positively
he runs over with learning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he needn&rsquo;t run over <i>me</i>!&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>The Professor was back in a moment: he had
changed his dressing-gown for a frock-coat,
and had put on a pair of very strange-looking
boots, the tops of which were open umbrellas.
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to see them,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;<i>These</i> are the boots for horizontal weather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use of wearing umbrellas
round one&rsquo;s knees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>ordinary</i> rain,&rdquo; the Professor admitted,
&ldquo;they would <i>not</i> be of much use. But if ever
it rained <i>horizontally</i>, you know, they would
be invaluable&mdash;simply invaluable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the Professor to the breakfast-saloon,
children,&rdquo; said the Warden. &ldquo;And tell them
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
not to wait for me. I had breakfast early, as
I&rsquo;ve some business to attend to.&rdquo; The children
seized the Professor&rsquo;s hands, as familiarly as if
they had known him for years, and hurried him
away. I followed respectfully behind.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">L&rsquo;AMIE INCONNUE.</span></h2>
<p>As we entered the breakfast-saloon, the Professor
was saying &ldquo;&mdash;and he had breakfast
by himself, early: so he begged you wouldn&rsquo;t
wait for him, my Lady. This way, my Lady,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;this way!&rdquo; And then, with (as it
seemed to me) most superfluous politeness, he
flung open the door of my compartment, and
ushered in &ldquo;&mdash;a young and lovely lady!&rdquo; I
muttered to myself with some bitterness. &ldquo;And
this is, of course, the opening scene of Vol. I.
<i>She</i> is the Heroine. And <i>I</i> am one of those
subordinate characters that only turn up when
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
needed for the development of her destiny, and
whose final appearance is outside the church,
waiting to greet the Happy Pair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lady, change at Fayfield,&rdquo; were
the next words I heard (oh that too obsequious
Guard!), &ldquo;next station but one.&rdquo; And the door
closed, and the lady settled down into her
corner, and the monotonous throb of the engine
(making one feel as if the train were some
gigantic monster, whose very circulation we
could feel) proclaimed that we were once more
speeding on our way. &ldquo;The lady had a perfectly
formed nose,&rdquo; I caught myself saying to
myself, &ldquo;hazel eyes, and lips&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and here it
occurred to me that to see, for myself, what
&ldquo;the lady&rdquo; was really like, would be more
satisfactory than much speculation.</p>
<p>I looked round cautiously, and&mdash;was entirely
disappointed of my hope. The veil,
which shrouded her whole face, was too thick
for me to see more than the glitter of bright
eyes and the hazy outline of what <i>might</i> be a
lovely oval face, but might also, unfortunately,
be an equally <i>un</i>lovely one. I closed my eyes
again, saying to myself &ldquo;&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t have a
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
better chance for an experiment in Telepathy!
I&rsquo;ll <i>think out</i> her face, and afterwards test the
portrait with the original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, no result at all crowned my efforts,
though I &lsquo;divided my swift mind,&rsquo; now hither,
now thither, in a way that I felt sure would
have made &AElig;neas green with envy: but the
dimly-seen oval remained as provokingly blank
as ever&mdash;a mere Ellipse, as if in some mathematical
diagram, without even the Foci that
might be made to do duty as a nose and a
mouth. Gradually, however, the conviction
came upon me that I could, by a certain concentration
of thought, <i>think the veil away</i>, and
so get a glimpse of the mysterious face&mdash;as
to which the two questions, &ldquo;is she pretty?&rdquo;
and &ldquo;is she plain?&rdquo;, still hung suspended, in
my mind, in beautiful equipoise.</p>
<p>Success was partial&mdash;and fitful&mdash;still there
<i>was</i> a result: ever and anon, the veil seemed
to vanish, in a sudden flash of light: but,
before I could fully realise the face, all was
dark again. In each such glimpse, the face
seemed to grow more childish and more innocent:
and, when I had at last <i>thought</i> the veil
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
entirely away, it was, unmistakeably, the sweet
face of little Sylvie!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, either I&rsquo;ve been dreaming about Sylvie,&rdquo;
I said to myself, &ldquo;and this is the reality. Or
else I&rsquo;ve really been with Sylvie, and this is a
dream! Is Life itself a dream, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To occupy the time, I got out the letter,
which had caused me to take this sudden railway-journey
from my London home down to a
strange fishing-town on the North coast, and
read it over again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc"><i>Dear old Friend</i></span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m sure it will be as great a pleasure
to me, as it can possibly be to you, to meet once
more after so many years: and of course I shall
be ready to give you all the benefit of such
medical skill as I have: only, you know, one
mustn&rsquo;t violate professional etiquette! And
you are already in the hands of a first-rate
London doctor, with whom it would be utter
affectation for me to pretend to compete. (I
make no doubt he is right in saying the heart
is affected: all your symptoms point that way.)
One thing, at any rate, I have already done in
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
my doctorial capacity&mdash;secured you a bedroom
on the ground-floor, so that you will not need
to ascend the stairs at all.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I shall expect you by last train on Friday,
in accordance with your letter: and, till then,
I shall say, in the words of the old song, &lsquo;Oh
for Friday nicht! Friday&rsquo;s lang a-coming!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;<i>Yours always</i>,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc"><i>Arthur Forester</i></span>.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S. Do you believe in Fate?</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Postscript puzzled me sorely. &ldquo;He is
far too sensible a man,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;to have
become a Fatalist. And yet what else can he
mean by it?&rdquo; And, as I folded up the letter
and put it away, I inadvertently repeated the
words aloud. &ldquo;Do you believe in Fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair &lsquo;Incognita&rsquo; turned her head quickly
at the sudden question. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she
said with a smile. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to ask the question!&rdquo; I
stammered, a little taken aback at having begun
a conversation in so unconventional a fashion.</p>
<p>The lady&rsquo;s smile became a laugh&mdash;not a
mocking laugh, but the laugh of a happy child
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
who is perfectly at her ease. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Then it was a case of what you
Doctors call &lsquo;unconscious cerebration&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no Doctor,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Do I look
so like one? Or what makes you think it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the book I had been reading,
which was so lying that its title, &ldquo;Diseases of
the Heart,&rdquo; was plainly visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One needn&rsquo;t be a <i>Doctor</i>,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to take
an interest in medical books. There&rsquo;s another
class of readers, who are yet more deeply
interested&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the <i>Patients</i>?&rdquo; she interrupted,
while a look of tender pity gave new sweetness
to her face. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; with an evident wish to
avoid a possibly painful topic, &ldquo;one needn&rsquo;t be
<i>either</i>, to take an interest in books of <i>Science</i>.
Which contain the greatest amount of Science,
do you think, the books, or the minds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a profound question for a lady!&rdquo; I
said to myself, holding, with the conceit so
natural to Man, that Woman&rsquo;s intellect is essentially
shallow. And I considered a minute
before replying. &ldquo;If you mean <i>living</i> minds,
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to decide. There is
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
so much <i>written</i> Science that no living person
has ever <i>read</i>: and there is so much <i>thought-out</i>
Science that hasn&rsquo;t yet been <i>written</i>. But,
if you mean the whole human race, then I
think the <i>minds</i> have it: everything, recorded
in <i>books</i>, must have once been in some <i>mind</i>,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather like one of the Rules in
Algebra?&rdquo; my Lady enquired. (&ldquo;<i>Algebra</i>
too!&rdquo; I thought with increasing wonder.) &ldquo;I
mean, if we consider thoughts as <i>factors</i>, may
we not say that the Least Common Multiple
of all the <i>minds</i> contains that of all the <i>books</i>;
but not the other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we may!&rdquo; I replied, delighted
with the illustration. &ldquo;And what a grand
thing it would be,&rdquo; I went on dreamily, thinking
aloud rather than talking, &ldquo;if we could
only <i>apply</i> that Rule to books! You know, in
finding the Least Common Multiple, we strike
out a quantity wherever it occurs, except in
the term where it is raised to its highest power.
So we should have to erase every recorded
thought, except in the sentence where it is
expressed with the greatest intensity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>My Lady laughed merrily. &ldquo;<i>Some</i> books
would be reduced to blank paper, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would. Most libraries would be
terribly diminished in <i>bulk</i>. But just think
what they would gain in <i>quality</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will it be done?&rdquo; she eagerly asked.
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any chance of it in <i>my</i> time, I think
I&rsquo;ll leave off reading, and wait for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps in another thousand years
or so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no use waiting!&rdquo; said my
Lady. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down. Uggug, my pet,
come and sit by me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere but by <i>me</i>!&rdquo; growled the Sub-Warden.
&ldquo;The little wretch always manages
to upset his coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guessed at once (as perhaps the reader will
also have guessed, if, like myself, he is <i>very</i>
clever at drawing conclusions) that my Lady
was the Sub-Warden&rsquo;s wife, and that Uggug
(a hideous fat boy, about the same age as
Sylvie, with the expression of a prize-pig) was
their son. Sylvie and Bruno, with the Lord
Chancellor, made up a party of seven.</p>

<p class="center small">A PORTABLE PLUNGE-BATH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you actually got a plunge-bath every
morning?&rdquo; said the Sub-Warden, seemingly
in continuation of a conversation with the Professor.
&ldquo;Even at the little roadside-inns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, certainly!&rdquo; the Professor
replied with a smile on his jolly face. &ldquo;Allow
me to explain. It is, in fact, a very simple
problem in Hydrodynamics. (That means a
combination of Water and Strength.) If we
take a plunge-bath, and a man of great strength
(such as myself) about to plunge into it, we
have a perfect example of this science. I am
bound to admit,&rdquo; the Professor continued, in a
lower tone and with downcast eyes, &ldquo;that we
need a man of <i>remarkable</i> strength. He must
be able to spring from the floor to about twice
his own height, gradually turning over as he
rises, so as to come down again head first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you need a <i>flea</i>, not a <i>man</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Sub-Warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;This
particular kind of bath is <i>not</i> adapted for a flea.
Let us suppose,&rdquo; he continued, folding his
table-napkin into a graceful festoon, &ldquo;that
this represents what is perhaps <i>the</i> necessity
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of this Age&mdash;the Active Tourist&rsquo;s Portable
Bath. You may describe it briefly, if you
like,&rdquo; looking at the Chancellor, &ldquo;by the
letters A. T. P. B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancellor, much disconcerted at finding
everybody looking at him, could only murmur,
in a shy whisper, &ldquo;Precisely so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One great advantage of this plunge-bath,&rdquo;
continued the Professor, &ldquo;is that it requires
only half-a-gallon of water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it a <i>plunge</i>-bath,&rdquo; His Sub-Excellency
remarked, &ldquo;unless your Active
Tourist goes <i>right under</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he <i>does</i> go right under,&rdquo; the old man
gently replied. &ldquo;The A. T. hangs up the P. B.
on a nail&mdash;<i>thus</i>. He then empties the water-jug
into it&mdash;places the empty jug below the
bag&mdash;leaps into the air&mdash;descends head-first
into the bag&mdash;the water rises round him to the
top of the bag&mdash;and there you are!&rdquo; he triumphantly
concluded. &ldquo;The A. T. is as much
under water as if he&rsquo;d gone a mile or two down
into the Atlantic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s drowned, let us say, in about four
minutes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; the Professor answered
with a proud smile. &ldquo;After about a minute,
he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the
P. B.&mdash;all the water runs back into the jug&mdash;and
there you are again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in the world is he to get <i>out</i> of
the bag again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i>, I take it,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;is the
most beautiful part of the whole invention. All
the way up the P. B., inside, are loops for the
thumbs; so it&rsquo;s something like going up-stairs,
only perhaps less comfortable; and, by the time
the A. T. has risen out of the bag, all but his
head, he&rsquo;s sure to topple over, one way or
the other&mdash;the Law of Gravity secures <i>that</i>.
And there he is on the floor again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bruised, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, a little bruised; but <i>having had
his plunge-bath</i>: that&rsquo;s the great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! It&rsquo;s almost beyond belief!&rdquo;
murmured the Sub-Warden. The Professor
took it as a compliment, and bowed with a
gratified smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quite</i> beyond belief!&rdquo; my Lady added&mdash;meaning,
no doubt, to be more complimentary
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
still. The Professor bowed, but he didn&rsquo;t smile
<i>this</i> time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;that,
<i>provided the bath was made</i>, I used it every
morning. I certainly <i>ordered</i> it&mdash;<i>that</i> I am
clear about&mdash;my only doubt is, whether the
man ever finished making it. It&rsquo;s difficult to
remember, after so many years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the door, very slowly and
creakingly, began to open, and Sylvie and
Bruno jumped up, and ran to meet the well-known
footstep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">BIRTHDAY-PRESENTS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my brother!&rdquo; the Sub-Warden exclaimed,
in a warning whisper. &ldquo;Speak out,
and be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appeal was evidently addressed to the
Lord Chancellor, who instantly replied, in a
shrill monotone, like a little boy repeating the
alphabet, &ldquo;As I was remarking, your Sub-Excellency,
this portentous movement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You began too soon!&rdquo; the other interrupted,
scarcely able to restrain himself to a
whisper, so great was his excitement. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t have heard you. Begin again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I was remarking,&rdquo; chanted the obedient
Lord Chancellor, &ldquo;this portentous movement
has already assumed the dimensions of a
Revolution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what <i>are</i> the dimensions of a
Revolution?&rdquo; The voice was genial and
mellow, and the face of the tall dignified old
man, who had just entered the room, leading
Sylvie by the hand, and with Bruno riding
triumphantly on his shoulder, was too noble
and gentle to have scared a less guilty man:
but the Lord Chancellor turned pale instantly,
and could hardly articulate the words &ldquo;The
dimensions&mdash;your&mdash;your High Excellency?
I&mdash;I&mdash;scarcely comprehend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the length, breadth, and thickness, if
you like it better!&rdquo; And the old man smiled,
half-contemptuously.</p>
<p>The Lord Chancellor recovered himself with
a great effort, and pointed to the open window.
&ldquo;If your High Excellency will listen for a
moment to the shouts of the exasperated
populace&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;of the exasperated populace!&rdquo;
the Sub-Warden repeated in a louder
tone, as the Lord Chancellor, being in a state
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
of abject terror, had dropped almost into a
whisper)&ldquo;&mdash;you will understand what it is
they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that moment there surged into the
room a hoarse confused cry, in which the
only clearly audible words were &ldquo;Less&mdash;bread&mdash;More&mdash;taxes!&rdquo;
The old man laughed
heartily. &ldquo;What in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he was
beginning: but the Chancellor heard him not.
&ldquo;Some mistake!&rdquo; he muttered, hurrying to
the window, from which he shortly returned
with an air of relief. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> listen!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, holding up his hand impressively.
And now the words came quite distinctly, and
with the regularity of the ticking of a clock,
&ldquo;More&mdash;bread&mdash;Less&mdash;taxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More bread!&rdquo; the Warden repeated in
astonishment. &ldquo;Why, the new Government
Bakery was opened only last week, and I
gave orders to sell the bread at cost-price
during the present scarcity! What <i>can</i> they
expect more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bakery&rsquo;s closed, y&rsquo;reince!&rdquo; the
Chancellor said, more loudly and clearly than
he had spoken yet. He was emboldened by
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the consciousness that <i>here</i>, at least, he had
evidence to produce: and he placed in the
Warden&rsquo;s hands a few printed notices, that
were lying ready, with some open ledgers, on
a side-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, <i>I</i> see!&rdquo; the Warden muttered,
glancing carelessly through them. &ldquo;Order
countermanded by my brother, and supposed
to be <i>my</i> doing! Rather sharp practice!
It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he added in a louder tone.
&ldquo;My name is signed to it: so I take it on
myself. But what do they mean by &lsquo;Less
Taxes&rsquo;? How <i>can</i> they be less? I abolished
the last of them a month ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been put on again, y&rsquo;reince, and by
y&rsquo;reince&rsquo;s own orders!&rdquo;, and other printed
notices were submitted for inspection.</p>
<p>The Warden, whilst looking them over,
glanced once or twice at the Sub-Warden,
who had seated himself before one of the open
ledgers, and was quite absorbed in adding it
up; but he merely repeated &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.
I accept it as my doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they do say,&rdquo; the Chancellor went on
sheepishly&mdash;looking much more like a convicted
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
thief than an Officer of State, &ldquo;that a
change of Government, by the abolition of the
Sub-Warden&mdash;I mean,&rdquo; he hastily added, on
seeing the Warden&rsquo;s look of astonishment, &ldquo;the
abolition of the <i>office</i> of Sub-Warden, and
giving the present holder the right to act as
<i>Vice</i>-Warden whenever the Warden is absent&mdash;would
appease all this seedling discontent.
I mean,&rdquo; he added, glancing at a paper he held
in his hand, &ldquo;all this <i>seething</i> discontent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For fifteen years,&rdquo; put in a deep but very
harsh voice, &ldquo;my husband has been acting as
Sub-Warden. It is too long! It is much too
long!&rdquo; My Lady was a vast creature at all
times: but, when she frowned and folded her
arms, as now, she looked more gigantic than
ever, and made one try to fancy what a
haystack would look like, if out of temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would distinguish himself as a Vice!&rdquo;
my Lady proceeded, being far too stupid to
see the double meaning of her words. &ldquo;There
has been no such Vice in Outland for many a
long year, as he would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What course would <i>you</i> suggest, Sister?&rdquo;
the Warden mildly enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>My Lady stamped, which was undignified:
and snorted, which was ungraceful. &ldquo;This is
no <i>jesting</i> matter!&rdquo; she bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will consult my brother,&rdquo; said the
Warden. &ldquo;Brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and seven makes a hundred and
ninety-four, which is sixteen and twopence,&rdquo;
the Sub-Warden replied. &ldquo;Put down two and
carry sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows,
lost in admiration. &ldquo;<i>Such</i> a man of
business!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, could I have a word with you
in my Study?&rdquo; the Warden said in a louder
tone. The Sub-Warden rose with alacrity,
and the two left the room together.</p>
<p>My Lady turned to the Professor, who
had uncovered the urn, and was taking its
temperature with his pocket-thermometer.
&ldquo;Professor!&rdquo; she began, so loudly and suddenly
that even Uggug, who had gone to
sleep in his chair, left off snoring and opened
one eye. The Professor pocketed his thermometer
in a moment, clasped his hands, and put
his head on one side with a meek smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were teaching my son before breakfast,
I believe?&rdquo; my Lady loftily remarked.
&ldquo;I hope he strikes you as having talent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very much so indeed, my Lady!&rdquo; the
Professor hastily replied, unconsciously rubbing
his ear, while some painful recollection seemed
to cross his mind. &ldquo;I was very forcibly struck
by His Magnificence, I assure you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a charming boy!&rdquo; my Lady exclaimed.
&ldquo;Even his snores are more musical
than those of other boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that <i>were</i> so, the Professor seemed to
think, the snores of <i>other</i> boys must be
something too awful to be endured: but he
was a cautious man, and he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s so clever!&rdquo; my Lady continued.
&ldquo;No one will enjoy your Lecture more&mdash;by
the way, have you fixed the time for it
yet? You&rsquo;ve never given one, you know: and
it was promised years ago, before you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, my Lady, <i>I</i> know! Perhaps next
Tuesday&mdash;or Tuesday week&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do very well,&rdquo; said my Lady,
graciously. &ldquo;Of course you will let the Other
Professor lecture as well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think <i>not</i>, my Lady,&rdquo; the Professor said
with some hesitation. &ldquo;You see, he always
stands with his back to the audience. It does
very well for <i>reciting</i>; but for <i>lecturing</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said my Lady. &ldquo;And,
now I come to think of it, there would hardly
be time for more than <i>one</i> Lecture. And it
will go off all the better, if we begin with a
Banquet, and a Fancy-dress Ball&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will indeed!&rdquo; the Professor cried, with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come as a Grass-hopper,&rdquo; my Lady
calmly proceeded. &ldquo;What shall <i>you</i> come as,
Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled feebly. &ldquo;I shall come
as&mdash;as early as I can, my Lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t come in before the doors are
opened,&rdquo; said my Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;Excuse me
a moment. As this is Lady Sylvie&rsquo;s birthday,
I would like to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he rushed away.</p>
<p>Bruno began feeling in his pockets, looking
more and more melancholy as he did so: then
he put his thumb in his mouth, and considered
for a minute: then he quietly left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He had hardly done so before the Professor
was back again, quite out of breath. &ldquo;Wishing
you many happy returns of the day, my dear
child!&rdquo; he went on, addressing the smiling
little girl, who had run to meet him. &ldquo;Allow
me to give you a birthday-present. It&rsquo;s a
second-hand pincushion, my dear. And it only
cost fourpence-halfpenny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, it&rsquo;s <i>very</i> pretty!&rdquo; And Sylvie
rewarded the old man with a hearty kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the <i>pins</i> they gave me for nothing!&rdquo;
the Professor added in high glee. &ldquo;Fifteen of
em, and only <i>one</i> bent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the bent one into a <i>hook</i>!&rdquo; said
Sylvie. &ldquo;To catch Bruno with, when he runs
away from his lessons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t guess what <i>my</i> present is!&rdquo; said
Uggug, who had taken the butter-dish from
the table, and was standing behind her, with a
wicked leer on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; Sylvie said without
looking up. She was still examining the Professor&rsquo;s
pincushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>this</i>!&rdquo; cried the bad boy, exultingly, as
he emptied the dish over her, and then, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
a grin of delight at his own cleverness, looked
round for applause.</p>
<p>Sylvie coloured crimson, as she shook off the
butter from her frock: but she kept her lips
tight shut, and walked away to the window,
where she stood looking out and trying to
recover her temper.</p>
<p>Uggug&rsquo;s triumph was a very short one: the
Sub-Warden had returned, just in time to be
a witness of his dear child&rsquo;s playfulness, and
in another moment a skilfully-applied box
on the ear had changed the grin of delight
into a howl of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; cried his mother, enfolding
him in her fat arms. &ldquo;Did they box his ears
for nothing? A precious pet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for <i>nothing</i>!&rdquo; growled the angry
father. &ldquo;Are you aware, Madam, that <i>I</i> pay
the house-bills, out of a fixed annual sum?
The loss of all that wasted butter falls on
<i>me</i>! Do you hear, Madam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Sir!&rdquo; My Lady spoke
very quietly&mdash;almost in a whisper. But there
was something in her <i>look</i> which silenced him.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it was only a <i>joke</i>? And a
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
very clever one, too! He only meant that he
loved nobody <i>but</i> her! And, instead of being
pleased with the compliment, the spiteful little
thing has gone away in a huff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sub-Warden was a very good hand at
changing a subject. He walked across to the
window. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that a <i>pig</i>
that I see down below, rooting about among
your flower-beds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>pig</i>!&rdquo; shrieked my Lady, rushing madly
to the window, and almost pushing her husband
out, in her anxiety to see for herself. &ldquo;Whose
pig is it? How did it get in? Where&rsquo;s that
crazy Gardener gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Bruno re-entered the room,
and passing Uggug (who was blubbering his
loudest, in the hope of attracting notice) as if
he was quite used to that sort of thing, he ran
up to Sylvie and threw his arms round her.
&ldquo;I went to my toy-cupboard,&rdquo; he said with
a very sorrowful face, &ldquo;to see if there were
<i>somefin</i> fit for a present for oo! And there
isn&rsquo;t <i>nuffin</i>! They&rsquo;s <i>all</i> broken, every one!
And I haven&rsquo;t got <i>no</i> money left, to buy oo
a birthday-present! And I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give oo
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
nuffin but <i>this</i>!&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>This</i>&rdquo; was a very earnest
hug and a kiss.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, darling!&rdquo; cried Sylvie. &ldquo;I
like <i>your</i> present best of all!&rdquo; (But if so,
why did she give it back so quickly?)</p>
<p>His Sub-Excellency turned and patted the
two children on the head with his long lean
hands. &ldquo;Go away, dears!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
business to talk over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie and Bruno went away hand in hand:
but, on reaching the door, Sylvie came back
again and went up to Uggug timidly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind about the butter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sorry he hurt you!&rdquo; And she tried to shake
hands with the little ruffian: but Uggug only
blubbered louder, and wouldn&rsquo;t make friends.
Sylvie left the room with a sigh.</p>
<p>The Sub-Warden glared angrily at his weeping
son. &ldquo;Leave the room, Sirrah!&rdquo; he said,
as loud as he dared. His wife was still leaning
out of the window, and kept repeating &ldquo;I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>
see that pig! Where <i>is</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s moved to the right&mdash;now it&rsquo;s gone a
little to the left,&rdquo; said the Sub-Warden: but
he had his back to the window, and was making
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
signals to the Lord Chancellor, pointing to
Uggug and the door, with many a cunning
nod and wink.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" alt="REMOVAL OF UGGUG" width="500" height="364" />
<p class="center small">REMOVAL OF UGGUG</p>
</div>
<p>The Chancellor caught his meaning at last,
and, crossing the room, took that interesting
child by the ear&mdash;the next moment he and
Uggug were out of the room, and the door shut
behind them: but not before one piercing yell
had rung through the room, and reached the
ears of the fond mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> that hideous noise?&rdquo; she fiercely
asked, turning upon her startled husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some hy&aelig;na&mdash;or other,&rdquo; replied the
Sub-Warden, looking vaguely up to the ceiling,
as if that was where they usually were to be
found. &ldquo;Let us to business, my dear. Here
comes the Warden.&rdquo; And he picked up from
the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript, on
which I just caught the words &lsquo;after which
Election duly holden the said Sibimet and
Tabikat his wife may at their pleasure assume
Imperial&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; before, with a guilty look, he
crumpled it up in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A CUNNING CONSPIRACY.</span></h2>
<p>The Warden entered at this moment: and
close behind him came the Lord Chancellor, a
little flushed and out of breath, and adjusting
his wig, which appeared to have been dragged
partly off his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is my precious child?&rdquo; my
Lady enquired, as the four took their seats at
the small side-table devoted to ledgers and
bundles and bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left the room a few minutes ago&mdash;with
the Lord Chancellor,&rdquo; the Sub-Warden
briefly explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my Lady, graciously smiling on
that high official. &ldquo;Your Lordship has a very
<i>taking</i> way with children! I doubt if any one
could <i>gain the ear</i> of my darling Uggug so
quickly as <i>you</i> can!&rdquo; For an entirely stupid
woman, my Lady&rsquo;s remarks were curiously full
of meaning, of which she herself was wholly
unconscious.</p>
<p>The Chancellor bowed, but with a very
uneasy air. &ldquo;I think the Warden was about
to speak,&rdquo; he remarked, evidently anxious to
change the subject.</p>
<p>But my Lady would not be checked. &ldquo;He
is a clever boy,&rdquo; she continued with enthusiasm,
&ldquo;but he needs a man like your Lordship to
<i>draw him out</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent.
He evidently feared that, stupid as she looked,
she understood what she said <i>this</i> time, and
was having a joke at his expense. He might
have spared himself all anxiety: whatever accidental
meaning her <i>words</i> might have, she
<i>herself</i> never meant anything at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all settled!&rdquo; the Warden announced,
wasting no time over preliminaries. &ldquo;The
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Sub-Wardenship is abolished, and my brother
is appointed to act as Vice-Warden whenever
I am absent. So, as I am going abroad for a
while, he will enter on his new duties at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there will really be a Vice after all?&rdquo;
my Lady enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; the Warden smilingly replied.</p>
<p>My Lady looked much pleased, and tried
to clap her hands: but you might as well have
knocked two feather-beds together, for any
noise it made. &ldquo;When my husband is Vice,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;it will be the same as if we had a
<i>hundred</i> Vices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried the Sub-Warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to think it very remarkable,&rdquo; my
Lady remarked with some severity, &ldquo;that your
wife should speak the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not <i>remarkable</i> at all!&rdquo; her husband
anxiously explained. &ldquo;<i>Nothing</i> is remarkable
that <i>you</i> say, sweet one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lady smiled approval of the sentiment,
and went on. &ldquo;And am I Vice-Wardeness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose to use that title,&rdquo; said the
Warden: &ldquo;but &lsquo;Your Excellency&rsquo; will be the
proper style of address. And I trust that both
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
&lsquo;<i>His</i> Excellency&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>Her</i> Excellency&rsquo; will
observe the Agreement I have drawn up. The
provision I am <i>most</i> anxious about is this.&rdquo;
He unrolled a large parchment scroll, and read
aloud the words &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>item</i>, that we will be kind
to the poor.&rsquo; The Chancellor worded it for
me,&rdquo; he added, glancing at that great Functionary.
&ldquo;I suppose, now, that word &lsquo;<i>item</i>&rsquo;
has some deep legal meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly!&rdquo; replied the Chancellor, as
articulately as he could with a pen between
his lips. He was nervously rolling and unrolling
several other scrolls, and making room
among them for the one the Warden had just
handed to him. &ldquo;These are merely the rough
copies,&rdquo; he explained: &ldquo;and, as soon as I have
put in the final corrections&mdash;&rdquo; making a great
commotion among the different parchments,
&ldquo;&mdash;a semi-colon or two that I have accidentally
omitted&mdash;&rdquo; here he darted about, pen in hand,
from one part of the scroll to another, spreading
sheets of blotting-paper over his corrections,
&ldquo;all will be ready for signing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should it not be read out, first?&rdquo; my
Lady enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need, no need!&rdquo; the Sub-Warden and
the Chancellor exclaimed at the same moment,
with feverish eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need at all,&rdquo; the Warden gently assented.
&ldquo;Your husband and I have gone through it
together. It provides that he shall exercise
the full authority of Warden, and shall have
the disposal of the annual revenue attached to
the office, until my return, or, failing that, until
Bruno comes of age: and that he shall then
hand over, to myself or to Bruno as the case
may be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue,
and the contents of the Treasury, which are to
be preserved, intact, under his guardianship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time the Sub-Warden was busy,
with the Chancellor&rsquo;s help, shifting the papers
from side to side, and pointing out to the
Warden the place where he was to sign. He
then signed it himself, and my Lady and the
Chancellor added their names as witnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short partings are best,&rdquo; said the Warden.
&ldquo;All is ready for my journey. My children
are waiting below to see me off.&rdquo; He gravely
kissed my Lady, shook hands with his brother
and the Chancellor, and left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/i048.jpg" alt="&lsquo;WHAT A GAME!&rsquo;" width="500" height="326" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;WHAT A GAME!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The three waited in silence till the sound
of wheels announced that the Warden was
out of hearing: then, to my surprise, they
broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a game, oh, what a game!&rdquo; cried
the Chancellor. And he and the Vice-Warden
joined hands, and skipped wildly about the
room. My Lady was too dignified to skip,
but she laughed like the neighing of a horse,
and waved her handkerchief above her head:
it was clear to her very limited understanding
that <i>something</i> very clever had been done, but
what it <i>was</i> she had yet to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said I should hear all about it when
the Warden had gone,&rdquo; she remarked, as soon
as she could make herself heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you shall, Tabby!&rdquo; her husband
graciously replied, as he removed the blotting-paper,
and showed the two parchments lying
side by side. &ldquo;This is the one he read but
didn&rsquo;t sign: and this is the one he signed but
didn&rsquo;t read! You see it was all covered up,
except the place for signing the names&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; my Lady interrupted eagerly,
and began comparing the two Agreements.
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Item</i>, that he shall exercise the authority
of Warden, in the Warden&rsquo;s absence.&rsquo; Why,
that&rsquo;s been changed into &lsquo;shall be absolute
governor for life, with the title of Emperor, if
elected to that office by the people.&rsquo; What!
Are you <i>Emperor</i>, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, dear,&rdquo; the Vice-Warden replied.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to let this paper be seen, just
at present. All in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lady nodded, and read on. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Item</i>, that
we will be kind to the poor.&rsquo; Why, that&rsquo;s
omitted altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course it is!&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re</i>
not going to bother about the wretches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Good</i>,&rdquo; said my Lady, with emphasis, and
read on again. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Item</i>, that the contents of
the Treasury be preserved intact.&rsquo; Why, that&rsquo;s
altered into &lsquo;shall be at the absolute disposal
of the Vice-Warden&rsquo;! Well, Sibby, that <i>was</i>
a clever trick! <i>All</i> the Jewels, only think!
May I go and put them on directly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not <i>just</i> yet, Lovey,&rdquo; her husband
uneasily replied. &ldquo;You see the public mind
isn&rsquo;t quite <i>ripe</i> for it yet. We must feel our
way. Of course we&rsquo;ll have the coach-and-four
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
out, at once. And I&rsquo;ll take the title of Emperor,
as soon as we can safely hold an Election.
But they&rsquo;ll hardly stand our using the
<i>Jewels</i>, as long as they know the Warden&rsquo;s
alive. We must spread a report of his death.
A little Conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Conspiracy!&rdquo; cried the delighted lady,
clapping her hands. &ldquo;Of all things, I <i>do</i> like
a Conspiracy! It&rsquo;s so interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden and the Chancellor interchanged
a wink or two. &ldquo;Let her conspire to
her heart&rsquo;s content!&rdquo; the cunning Chancellor
whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do no harm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will the Conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; her husband hastily interrupted
her, as the door opened, and Sylvie and Bruno
came in, with their arms twined lovingly round
each other&mdash;Bruno sobbing convulsively, with
his face hidden on his sister&rsquo;s shoulder, and
Sylvie more grave and quiet, but with tears
streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t cry like that!&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
said sharply, but without any effect on the
weeping children. &ldquo;Cheer &rsquo;em up a bit!&rdquo; he
hinted to my Lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cake!</i>&rdquo; my Lady muttered to herself with
great decision, crossing the room and opening a
cupboard, from which she presently returned
with two slices of plum-cake. &ldquo;Eat, and don&rsquo;t
cry!&rdquo; were her short and simple orders: and
the poor children sat down side by side, but
seemed in no mood for eating.</p>
<p>For the second time the door opened&mdash;or
rather was <i>burst</i> open, this time, as Uggug
rushed violently into the room, shouting &ldquo;that
old Beggar&rsquo;s come again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not to have any food&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
was beginning, but the Chancellor
interrupted him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, in a
low voice: &ldquo;the servants have their orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just under here,&rdquo; said Uggug, who had
gone to the window, and was looking down into
the court-yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, my darling?&rdquo; said his fond mother,
flinging her arms round the neck of the little
monster. All of us (except Sylvie and Bruno,
who took no notice of what was going on)
followed her to the window. The old Beggar
looked up at us with hungry eyes. &ldquo;Only a
crust of bread, your Highness!&rdquo; he pleaded.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
He was a fine
old man, but
looked sadly
ill and worn.
&ldquo;A crust of
bread is what
I crave!&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;A
single crust, and
a little water!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" alt="&lsquo;DRINK THIS!&rsquo;" width="500" height="1158" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;DRINK THIS!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some
water, drink this!&rdquo;
Uggug bellowed, emptying
a jug of water over
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, my boy!&rdquo;
cried the Vice-Warden.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to settle
such folk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever boy!&rdquo; the
Wardeness chimed
in. &ldquo;<i>Hasn&rsquo;t</i> he
good spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a stick
to him!&rdquo; shouted
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Vice-Warden, as the old Beggar shook the
water from his ragged cloak, and again gazed
meekly upwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a red-hot poker to him!&rdquo; my Lady
again chimed in.</p>
<p>Possibly there was no red-hot poker handy:
but some <i>sticks</i> were forthcoming in a moment,
and threatening faces surrounded the poor old
wanderer, who waved them back with quiet
dignity. &ldquo;No need to break my old bones,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I am going. Not even a crust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, <i>poor</i> old man!&rdquo; exclaimed a little voice
at my side, half choked with sobs. Bruno was
at the window, trying to throw out his slice of
plum-cake, but Sylvie held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>shall</i> have my cake!&rdquo; Bruno cried, passionately
struggling out of Sylvie&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, darling!&rdquo; Sylvie gently pleaded.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t <i>throw</i> it out! He&rsquo;s gone away,
don&rsquo;t you see? Let&rsquo;s go after him.&rdquo; And she
led him out of the room, unnoticed by the rest
of the party, who were wholly absorbed in
watching the old Beggar.</p>
<p>The Conspirators returned to their seats, and
continued their conversation in an undertone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
so as not to be heard by Uggug, who was still
standing at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, there was something about
Bruno succeeding to the Wardenship,&rdquo; said
my Lady. &ldquo;How does <i>that</i> stand in the
new Agreement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chancellor chuckled. &ldquo;Just the same,
word for word,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with <i>one</i> exception,
my Lady. Instead of &lsquo;Bruno,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve taken the
liberty to put in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he dropped his voice to
a whisper, &ldquo;&mdash;to put in &lsquo;Uggug,&rsquo; you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uggug, indeed!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in a burst
of indignation I could no longer control. To
bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic
effort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort
ceased at once: a sudden gust swept away
the whole scene, and I found myself sitting
up, staring at the young lady in the opposite
corner of the carriage, who had now thrown
back her veil, and was looking at me with
an expression of amused surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A BEGGAR&rsquo;S PALACE.</span></h2>
<p>That I had said <i>something</i>, in the act of
waking, I felt sure: the hoarse stifled cry was
still ringing in my ears, even if the startled
look of my fellow-traveler had not been evidence
enough: but what could I possibly say
by way of apology?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t frighten you?&rdquo; I stammered
out at last. &ldquo;I have no idea what I
said. I was dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said &lsquo;<i>Uggug indeed!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; the young lady
replied, with quivering lips that <i>would</i> curve
themselves into a smile, in spite of all her
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
efforts to look grave. &ldquo;At least&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t
<i>say</i> it&mdash;you <i>shouted</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; was all I could say, feeling
very penitent and helpless. &ldquo;She <i>has</i> Sylvie&rsquo;s
eyes!&rdquo; I thought to myself, half-doubting
whether, even now, I were fairly awake. &ldquo;And
that sweet look of innocent wonder is all
Sylvie&rsquo;s, too. But Sylvie <i>hasn&rsquo;t</i> got that calm
resolute mouth&mdash;nor that far-away look of
dreamy sadness, like one that has had some
deep sorrow, very long ago&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And the
thick-coming fancies almost prevented my hearing
the lady&rsquo;s next words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had had a &lsquo;Shilling Dreadful&rsquo; in
your hand,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;something about
Ghosts&mdash;or Dynamite&mdash;or Midnight Murder&mdash;one
could understand it: those things
aren&rsquo;t worth the shilling, unless they give one a
Nightmare. But really&mdash;with only a <i>medical
treatise</i>, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she glanced,
with a pretty shrug of contempt, at the book
over which I had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Her friendliness, and utter unreserve, took
me aback for a moment; yet there was no touch
of forwardness, or boldness, about the child&mdash;for
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
child, almost, she seemed to be: I guessed
her at scarcely over twenty&mdash;all was the innocent
frankness of some angelic visitant, new
to the ways of earth and the conventionalisms&mdash;or,
if you will, the barbarisms&mdash;of Society.
&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; I mused, &ldquo;will <i>Sylvie</i> look and
speak, in another ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care for Ghosts, then,&rdquo; I ventured
to suggest, &ldquo;unless they are really terrifying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; the lady assented. &ldquo;The regular
Railway-Ghosts&mdash;I mean the Ghosts of ordinary
Railway-literature&mdash;are very poor affairs.
I feel inclined to say, with Alexander Selkirk,
&lsquo;Their tameness is shocking to me&rsquo;! And they
never do any Midnight Murders. They couldn&rsquo;t
&lsquo;welter in gore,&rsquo; to save their lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Weltering in gore&rsquo; is a very expressive
phrase, certainly. Can it be done in <i>any</i> fluid,
I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think <i>not</i>,&rdquo; the lady readily replied&mdash;quite
as if she had thought it out, long ago.
&ldquo;It has to be something <i>thick</i>. For instance,
you might welter in bread-sauce. That, being
<i>white</i>, would be more suitable for a Ghost,
supposing it wished to welter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have a real good <i>terrifying</i> Ghost
in that book?&rdquo; I hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>could</i> you guess?&rdquo; she exclaimed
with the most engaging frankness, and placed
the volume in my hands. I opened it eagerly,
with a not unpleasant thrill (like what a good
ghost-story gives one) at the &lsquo;uncanny&rsquo; coincidence
of my having so unexpectedly divined
the subject of her studies.</p>
<p>It was a book of Domestic Cookery, open
at the article &lsquo;Bread Sauce.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I returned the book, looking, I suppose, a
little blank, as the lady laughed merrily at my
discomfiture. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far more exciting than some
of the modern ghosts, I assure you! Now there
was a Ghost last month&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean a <i>real</i>
Ghost in&mdash;in Supernature&mdash;but in a Magazine.
It was a perfectly <i>flavourless</i> Ghost. It
wouldn&rsquo;t have frightened a mouse! It wasn&rsquo;t
a Ghost that one would even offer a chair to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three score years and ten, baldness, and
spectacles, have their advantages after all!&rdquo; I
said to myself. &ldquo;Instead of a bashful youth
and maiden, gasping out monosyllables at awful
intervals, here we have an old man and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
child, quite at their ease, talking as if they had
known each other for years! Then you think,&rdquo;
I continued aloud, &ldquo;that we ought <i>sometimes</i> to
ask a Ghost to sit down? But have we any
authority for it? In Shakespeare, for instance&mdash;there
are plenty of ghosts <i>there</i>&mdash;does
Shakespeare ever give the stage-direction
&lsquo;<i>hands chair to Ghost</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for
a moment: then she <i>almost</i> clapped her hands.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, he <i>does</i>!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He makes
Hamlet say &lsquo;<i>Rest, rest, perturbed Spirit!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, I suppose, means an easy-chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An American rocking-chair, I <i>think</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fayfield Junction, my Lady, change for
Elveston!&rdquo; the guard announced, flinging open
the door of the carriage: and we soon found
ourselves, with all our portable property around
us, on the platform.</p>
<p>The accommodation, provided for passengers
waiting at this Junction, was distinctly inadequate&mdash;a
single wooden bench, apparently
intended for three sitters only: and even this
was already partially occupied by a very old
man, in a smock frock, who sat, with rounded
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
shoulders and drooping head, and with hands
clasped on the top of his stick so as to make
a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with
its look of patient weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, you be off!&rdquo; the Station-master
roughly accosted the poor old man. &ldquo;You
be off, and make way for your betters! This
way, my Lady!&rdquo; he added in a perfectly different
tone. &ldquo;If your Ladyship will take a
seat, the train will be up in a few minutes.&rdquo;
The cringing servility of his manner was due,
no doubt, to the address legible on the pile of
luggage, which announced their owner to be
&ldquo;Lady Muriel Orme, passenger to Elveston,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Fayfield Junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I watched the old man slowly rise to his
feet, and hobble a few paces down the platform,
the lines came to my lips:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;From sackcloth couch the Monk arose,</p>
<p class="t">With toil his stiffen&rsquo;d limbs he rear&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">A hundred years had flung their snows</p>
<p class="t">On his thin locks and floating beard.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/i062.jpg" alt="&lsquo;COME, YOU BE OFF!&rsquo;" width="500" height="717" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;COME, YOU BE OFF!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the lady scarcely noticed the little incident.
After one glance at the &lsquo;banished
man,&rsquo; who stood tremulously leaning on his
stick, she turned to me. &ldquo;This is <i>not</i> an
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
American rocking-chair, by any means! Yet
may I say,&rdquo; slightly changing her place, so as
to make room for me beside her, &ldquo;may I say,
in Hamlet&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;Rest, rest&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; she broke
off with a silvery laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;perturbed Spirit!&rsquo;&rdquo; I finished the
sentence for her. &ldquo;Yes, that describes a railway-traveler
<i>exactly</i>! And here is an instance
of it,&rdquo; I added, as the tiny local train drew
up alongside the platform, and the porters
bustled about, opening carriage-doors&mdash;one of
them helping the poor old man to hoist himself
into a third-class carriage, while another
of them obsequiously conducted the lady and
myself into a first-class.</p>
<p>She paused, before following him, to watch
the progress of the other passenger. &ldquo;Poor
old man!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How weak and ill he
looks! It was a shame to let him be turned
away like that. I&rsquo;m very sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; At this
moment it dawned on me that these words
were not addressed to <i>me</i>, but that she was
unconsciously thinking aloud. I moved away
a few steps, and waited to follow her into the
carriage, where I resumed the conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shakespeare <i>must</i> have traveled by rail,
if only in a dream: &lsquo;perturbed Spirit&rsquo; is such
a happy phrase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perturbed&rsquo; referring, no doubt,&rdquo; she rejoined,
&ldquo;to the sensational booklets peculiar
to the Rail. If Steam has done nothing else,
it has at least added a whole new Species
to English Literature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;The true
origin of all our medical books&mdash;and all our
cookery-books&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she broke in merrily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean <i>our</i> Literature! <i>We</i> are quite abnormal.
But the booklets&mdash;the little thrilling romances,
where the Murder comes at page fifteen, and
the Wedding at page forty&mdash;surely <i>they</i> are
due to Steam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we travel by Electricity&mdash;if I
may venture to develop your theory&mdash;we
shall have leaflets instead of booklets, and
the Murder and the Wedding will come on
the same page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A development worthy of Darwin!&rdquo; the
lady exclaimed enthusiastically. &ldquo;Only <i>you</i>
reverse his theory. Instead of developing a
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
mouse into an elephant, you would develop
an elephant into a mouse!&rdquo; But here we
plunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back and
closed my eyes for a moment, trying to recall
a few of the incidents of my recent dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I murmured sleepily:
and then the phrase insisted on conjugating
itself, and ran into &ldquo;you thought you saw&mdash;he
thought he saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then it suddenly
went off into a song:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw an Elephant,</p>
<p class="t">That practised on a fife:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A letter from his wife.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;At length I realise,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;The bitterness of Life!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And what a wild being it was who sang
these wild words! A Gardener he seemed to
be&mdash;yet surely a mad one, by the way he
brandished his rake&mdash;madder, by the way he
broke, ever and anon, into a frantic jig&mdash;maddest
of all, by the shriek in which he
brought out the last words of the stanza!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>It was so far a description
of himself
that he had the <i>feet</i>
of an Elephant: but
the rest of him was
skin and bone: and
the wisps of loose
straw, that bristled
all about him, suggested
that he had
been originally stuffed
with it, and that
nearly all the stuffing
had come out.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/i066.jpg" alt="THE GARDENER" width="500" height="785" />
<p class="center small">THE GARDENER</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie and Bruno waited patiently till the
end of the first verse. Then Sylvie advanced
alone (Bruno having suddenly turned shy) and
timidly introduced herself with the words
&ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s that other thing?&rdquo; said the
Gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; said Sylvie, looking round.
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Bruno. He&rsquo;s my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he your brother yesterday?&rdquo; the
Gardener anxiously enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Course I were!&rdquo; cried Bruno, who had
gradually crept nearer, and didn&rsquo;t at all like
being talked about without having his share
in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; the Gardener said with a kind
of groan. &ldquo;Things change so, here. Whenever
I look again, it&rsquo;s sure to be something
different! Yet I does my duty! I gets up
wriggle-early at five&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was <i>oo</i>,&rdquo; said Bruno, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
wriggle so early. It&rsquo;s as bad as being a
worm!&rdquo; he added, in an undertone to Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t be lazy in the morning,
Bruno,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s the
<i>early</i> bird that picks up the worm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may, if it likes!&rdquo; Bruno said with a
slight yawn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like eating worms, one
bit. I always stop in bed till the early bird
has picked them up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you&rsquo;ve the face to tell me such
fibs!&rdquo; cried the Gardener.</p>
<p>To which Bruno wisely replied &ldquo;Oo don&rsquo;t
want a <i>face</i> to tell fibs wiz&mdash;only a <i>mouf</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie discreetly changed the subject. &ldquo;And
did you plant all these flowers?&rdquo; she said.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
&ldquo;What a lovely garden you&rsquo;ve made! Do
you know, I&rsquo;d like to live here <i>always</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the winter-nights&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the Gardener
was beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d nearly forgotten what we came
about!&rdquo; Sylvie interrupted. &ldquo;Would you
please let us through into the road? There&rsquo;s
a poor old beggar just gone out&mdash;and he&rsquo;s
very hungry&mdash;and Bruno wants to give him
his cake, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as much as my place is worth!&rdquo; the
Gardener muttered, taking a key from his
pocket, and beginning to unlock a door in
the garden-wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much <i>are</i> it wurf?&rdquo; Bruno innocently
enquired.</p>
<p>But the Gardener only grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
secret!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mind you come back
quick!&rdquo; he called after the children, as they
passed out into the road. I had just time to
follow them, before he shut the door again.</p>
<p>We hurried down the road, and very soon
caught sight of the old Beggar, about a
quarter of a mile ahead of us, and the children
at once set off running to overtake him.
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the
ground, and I could not in the least understand
how it was I kept up with them so easily. But
the unsolved problem did not worry me so
much as at another time it might have done,
there were so many other things to attend to.</p>
<p>The old Beggar must have been very deaf, as
he paid no attention whatever to Bruno&rsquo;s eager
shouting, but trudged wearily on, never pausing
until the child got in front of him and held up
the slice of cake. The poor little fellow was
quite out of breath, and could only utter the one
word &ldquo;Cake!&rdquo;&mdash;not with the gloomy decision
with which Her Excellency had so lately pronounced
it, but with a sweet childish timidity,
looking up into the old man&rsquo;s face with eyes
that loved &lsquo;all things both great and small.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man snatched it from him, and devoured
it greedily, as some hungry wild beast
might have done, but never a word of thanks
did he give his little benefactor&mdash;only growled
&ldquo;More, more!&rdquo; and glared at the half-frightened
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> no more!&rdquo; Sylvie said with tears
in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d eaten mine. It was a shame
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
to let you be turned away like that. I&rsquo;m
very sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lost the rest of the sentence, for my mind
had recurred, with a great shock of surprise, to
Lady Muriel Orme, who had so lately uttered
these very words of Sylvie&rsquo;s&mdash;yes, and in
Sylvie&rsquo;s own voice, and with Sylvie&rsquo;s gentle
pleading eyes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; were the next words I heard,
as the old man waved his hand, with a dignified
grace that ill suited his ragged dress, over a
bush, that stood by the road side, which began
instantly to sink into the earth. At another
time I might have doubted the evidence of
my eyes, or at least have felt some astonishment:
but, in <i>this</i> strange scene, my whole
being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as
to what would happen next.</p>
<p>When the bush had sunk quite out of our
sight, marble steps were seen, leading downwards
into darkness. The old man led the way,
and we eagerly followed.</p>
<p>The staircase was so dark, at first, that I could
only just see the forms of the children, as, hand-in-hand,
they groped their way down after their
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
guide: but it got lighter every moment, with a
strange silvery brightness, that seemed to exist
in the air, as there were no lamps visible; and,
when at last we reached a level floor, the room,
in which we found ourselves, was almost as
light as day.</p>
<p>It was eight-sided, having in each angle a
slender pillar, round which silken draperies
were twined. The wall between the pillars was
entirely covered, to the height of six or seven
feet, with creepers, from which hung quantities
of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers, that almost
hid the leaves. In another place, perchance, I
might have wondered to see fruit and flowers
growing together: here, my chief wonder was
that neither fruit nor flowers were such as I
had ever seen before. Higher up, each wall
contained a circular window of coloured glass;
and over all was an arched roof, that seemed
to be spangled all over with jewels.</p>
<p>With hardly less wonder, I turned this way
and that, trying to make out how in the world
we had come in: for there was no door: and
all the walls were thickly covered with the
lovely creepers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe here, my darlings!&rdquo; said the
old man, laying a hand on Sylvie&rsquo;s shoulder, and
bending down to kiss her. Sylvie drew back
hastily, with an offended air: but in another
moment, with a glad cry of &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s <i>Father</i>!&rdquo;,
she had run into his arms.</p>

<p class="center small">A BEGGAR&rsquo;S PALACE</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father! Father!&rdquo; Bruno repeated: and,
while the happy children were being hugged
and kissed, I could but rub my eyes and say
&ldquo;Where, then, are the rags gone to?&rdquo;; for the
old man was now dressed in royal robes that
glittered with jewels and gold embroidery, and
wore a circlet of gold around his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAGIC LOCKET.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we, father?&rdquo; Sylvie whispered,
with her arms twined closely around the old
man&rsquo;s neck, and with her rosy cheek lovingly
pressed to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Elfland, darling. It&rsquo;s one of the provinces
of Fairyland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought Elfland was <i>ever</i> so far
from Outland: and we&rsquo;ve come such a <i>tiny</i>
little way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came by the Royal Road, sweet one.
Only those of royal blood can travel along it:
but <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> been royal ever since I was made
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
King of Elfland&mdash;that&rsquo;s nearly a month ago.
They sent <i>two</i> ambassadors, to make sure
that their invitation to me, to be their new
King, should reach me. One was a Prince;
so <i>he</i> was able to come by the Royal Road,
and to come invisibly to all but me: the other
was a Baron; so <i>he</i> had to come by the
common road, and I dare say he hasn&rsquo;t even
<i>arrived</i> yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how far have we come?&rdquo; Sylvie
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a thousand miles, sweet one, since the
Gardener unlocked that door for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand miles!&rdquo; Bruno repeated.
&ldquo;And may I eat one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat a <i>mile</i>, little rogue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;I mean may I eat one
of that fruits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child,&rdquo; said his father: &ldquo;and then
you&rsquo;ll find out what <i>Pleasure</i> is like&mdash;the
Pleasure we all seek so madly, and enjoy so
mournfully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno ran eagerly to the wall, and picked a
fruit that was <i>shaped</i> something like a banana,
but had the <i>colour</i> of a strawberry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He ate it with beaming looks, that became
gradually more gloomy, and were very blank
indeed by the time he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t got no taste at all!&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t feel nuffin in my mouf! It&rsquo;s a&mdash;what&rsquo;s
that hard word, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a <i>Phlizz</i>,&rdquo; Sylvie gravely replied.
&ldquo;Are they <i>all</i> like that, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all like that to <i>you</i>, darling, because
you don&rsquo;t belong to Elfland&mdash;yet. But
to <i>me</i> they are real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked puzzled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try anuvver
kind of fruits!&rdquo; he said, and jumped down off
the King&rsquo;s knee. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some lovely striped
ones, just like a rainbow!&rdquo; And off he ran.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Fairy-King and Sylvie were
talking together, but in such low tones that I
could not catch the words: so I followed Bruno,
who was picking and eating other kinds of
fruit, in the vain hope of finding <i>some</i> that had
a taste. I tried to pick some myself&mdash;but it
was like grasping air, and I soon gave up the
attempt and returned to Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look well at it, my darling,&rdquo; the old man
was saying, &ldquo;and tell me how you like it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just <i>lovely</i>,&rdquo; cried Sylvie, delightedly.
&ldquo;Bruno, come and look!&rdquo; And she held up,
so that he might see the light through it, a
heart-shaped Locket, apparently cut out of a
single jewel, of a rich blue colour, with a
slender gold chain attached to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It are welly pretty,&rdquo; Bruno more soberly
remarked: and he began spelling out some
words inscribed on it. &ldquo;All&mdash;will&mdash;love&mdash;Sylvie,&rdquo;
he made them out at last. &ldquo;And so
they doos!&rdquo; he cried, clasping his arms round
her neck. &ldquo;<i>Everybody</i> loves Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>we</i> love her best, don&rsquo;t we, Bruno?&rdquo;
said the old King, as he took possession of the
Locket. &ldquo;Now, Sylvie, look at <i>this</i>.&rdquo; And he
showed her, lying on the palm of his hand,
a Locket of a deep crimson colour, the same
shape as the blue one and, like it, attached
to a slender golden chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovelier and lovelier!&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvie,
clasping her hands in ecstasy. &ldquo;Look, Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s words on this one, too,&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;Sylvie&mdash;will&mdash;love&mdash;all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see the difference,&rdquo; said the old
man: &ldquo;different colours and different words.
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
Choose one of them, darling. I&rsquo;ll give you
whichever you like best.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center small">THE CRIMSON LOCKET</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie whispered the words, several times
over, with a thoughtful smile, and then made
her decision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>very</i> nice to be loved,&rdquo;
she said: &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s nicer to love other people!
May I have the red one, Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said nothing: but I could see
his eyes fill with tears, as he bent his head
and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long
loving kiss. Then he undid the chain, and
showed her how to fasten it round her neck,
and to hide it away under the edge of her
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
frock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you to <i>keep</i>, you know,&rdquo; he
said in a low voice, &ldquo;not for other people to
<i>see</i>. You&rsquo;ll remember how to use it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, darlings, it&rsquo;s time for you to
go back, or they&rsquo;ll be missing you, and then
that poor Gardener will get into trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more a feeling of wonder rose in my
mind as to how in the world we were to <i>get</i>
back again&mdash;since I took it for granted that,
wherever the children went, <i>I</i> was to go&mdash;but
no shadow of doubt seemed to cross <i>their</i>
minds, as they hugged and kissed him, murmuring,
over and over again, &ldquo;Good-bye,
darling Father!&rdquo; And then, suddenly and
swiftly, the darkness of midnight seemed to
close in upon us, and through the darkness
harshly rang a strange wild song:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw a Buffalo</p>
<p class="t">Upon the chimney-piece:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">His Sisters Husband&rsquo;s Niece.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Unless you leave this house,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send for the Police!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center small">&lsquo;HE THOUGHT HE SAW A BUFFALO&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was <i>me</i>!&rdquo; he added, looking out at
us, through the half-opened door, as we stood
waiting in the road. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d
have done&mdash;as sure as potatoes aren&rsquo;t radishes&mdash;if
she hadn&rsquo;t have tooken herself off! But
I always loves my <i>pay-rints</i> like anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are oor <i>pay-rints</i>?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them as pay <i>rint</i> for me, a course!&rdquo; the
Gardener replied. &ldquo;You can come in now, if
you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung the door open as he spoke, and we
got out, a little dazzled and stupefied (at least <i>I</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
felt so) at the sudden transition from the half-darkness
of the railway-carriage to the brilliantly-lighted
platform of Elveston Station.</p>
<p>A footman, in a handsome livery, came
forwards and respectfully touched his hat.
&ldquo;The carriage is here, my Lady,&rdquo; he said,
taking from her the wraps and small articles
she was carrying: and Lady Muriel, after
shaking hands and bidding me &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
with a pleasant smile, followed him.</p>
<p>It was with a somewhat blank and lonely
feeling that I betook myself to the van from
which the luggage was being taken out: and,
after giving directions to have my boxes sent
after me, I made my way on foot to Arthur&rsquo;s
lodgings, and soon lost my lonely feeling in the
hearty welcome my old friend gave me, and
the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the little
sitting-room into which he led me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little, as you see, but quite enough for us
two. Now, take the easy-chair, old fellow, and
let&rsquo;s have another look at you! Well, you <i>do</i>
look a bit pulled down!&rdquo; and he put on a
solemn professional air. &ldquo;I prescribe Ozone,
<i>quant. suff.</i> Social dissipation, <i>fiant pilul&aelig;
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
quam plurim&aelig;</i>: to be taken, feasting, three
times a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doctor!&rdquo; I remonstrated. &ldquo;Society
doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;receive&rsquo; three times a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all <i>you</i> know about it!&rdquo; the young
Doctor gaily replied. &ldquo;At home, lawn-tennis,
3 <span class="small">P.M.</span> At home, kettledrum, 5 <span class="small">P.M.</span> At home,
music (Elveston doesn&rsquo;t give dinners), 8 <span class="small">P.M.</span>
Carriages at 10. There you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounded very pleasant, I was obliged to
admit. &ldquo;And I know some of the <i>lady</i>-society
already,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;One of them came in
the same carriage with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was she like? Then perhaps I can
identify her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>name</i> was Lady Muriel Orme. As to
what she was <i>like</i>&mdash;well, <i>I</i> thought her very
beautiful. Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I do know her.&rdquo; And the grave
Doctor coloured slightly as he added &ldquo;Yes, I
agree with you. She <i>is</i> beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> quite lost my heart to her!&rdquo; I went on
mischievously. &ldquo;We talked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some supper!&rdquo; Arthur interrupted
with an air of relief, as the maid entered with
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the tray. And he steadily resisted all my
attempts to return to the subject of Lady
Muriel until the evening had almost worn itself
away. Then, as we sat gazing into the fire,
and conversation was lapsing into silence, he
made a hurried confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t meant to tell you anything about
her,&rdquo; he said (naming no names, as if there
were only one &lsquo;she&rsquo; in the world!) &ldquo;till you
had seen more of her, and formed your own
judgment of her: but somehow you surprised
it out of me. And I&rsquo;ve not breathed a word
of it to any one else. But I can trust <i>you</i> with
a secret, old friend! Yes! It&rsquo;s true of <i>me</i>,
what I suppose <i>you</i> said in jest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the merest jest, believe me!&rdquo; I said
earnestly. &ldquo;Why, man, I&rsquo;m three times her
age! But if she&rsquo;s <i>your</i> choice, then I&rsquo;m sure
she&rsquo;s all that is good and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and sweet,&rdquo; Arthur went on, &ldquo;and pure,
and self-denying, and true-hearted, and&mdash;&rdquo; he
broke off hastily, as if he could not trust himself
to say more on a subject so sacred and so
precious. Silence followed: and I leaned back
drowsily in my easy-chair, filled with bright
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
and beautiful imaginings of Arthur and his
lady-love, and of all the peace and happiness
in store for them.</p>
<p>I pictured them to myself walking together,
lingeringly and lovingly, under arching trees,
in a sweet garden of their own, and welcomed
back by their faithful gardener, on their return
from some brief excursion.</p>
<p>It seemed natural enough that the gardener
should be filled with exuberant delight at the
return of so gracious a master and mistress&mdash;and
how strangely childlike they looked!
I could have taken them for Sylvie and Bruno&mdash;less
natural that he should show it by such
wild dances, such crazy songs!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw a Rattlesnake</p>
<p class="t2">That questioned him in Greek:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t2">The Middle of Next Week.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The one thing I regret,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t2">&lsquo;Is that it cannot speak!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;least natural of all that the Vice-Warden
and &lsquo;my Lady&rsquo; should be standing close beside
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
me, discussing an open letter, which had
just been handed to him by the Professor,
who stood, meekly waiting, a few yards off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were not for those two brats,&rdquo; I
heard him mutter, glancing savagely at Sylvie
and Bruno, who were courteously listening to
the Gardener&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;there would be no
difficulty whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear that bit of the letter again,&rdquo;
said my Lady. And the Vice-Warden read
aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and we therefore entreat you graciously
to accept the Kingship, to which you
have been unanimously elected by the Council
of Elfland: and that you will allow your
son Bruno&mdash;of whose goodness, cleverness,
and beauty, reports have reached us&mdash;to be
regarded as Heir-Apparent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the difficulty?&rdquo; said my Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see? The Ambassador,
that brought this, is waiting in the house:
and he&rsquo;s sure to see Sylvie and Bruno: and
then, when he sees Uggug, and remembers
all that about &lsquo;goodness, cleverness, and
beauty,&rsquo; why, he&rsquo;s sure to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>where</i> will you find a better boy than
<i>Uggug</i>?&rdquo; my Lady indignantly interrupted.
&ldquo;Or a wittier, or a lovelier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all of which the Vice-Warden simply
replied &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be a great blethering
goose! Our only chance is to keep those
two brats out of sight. If <i>you</i> can manage
<i>that</i>, you may leave the rest to <i>me</i>. <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> make
him believe Uggug to be a model of cleverness
and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must change his name to Bruno, of
course?&rdquo; said my Lady.</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden rubbed his chin. &ldquo;Humph!
No!&rdquo; he said musingly. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t do. The
boy&rsquo;s such an utter idiot, he&rsquo;d never learn to
answer to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Idiot</i>, indeed!&rdquo; cried my Lady. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
no more an idiot than <i>I</i> am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, my dear,&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
soothingly replied. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lady was appeased. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in and
receive the Ambassador,&rdquo; she said, and beckoned
to the Professor. &ldquo;Which room is he waiting
in?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Library, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>what</i> did you say his name was?&rdquo;
said the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>The Professor referred to a card he held
in his hand. &ldquo;His Adiposity the Baron
Doppelgeist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he come with such a funny
name?&rdquo; said my Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t well change it on the journey,&rdquo;
the Professor meekly replied, &ldquo;because
of the luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> go and receive him,&rdquo; my Lady said
to the Vice-Warden, &ldquo;and <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> attend to the
children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE BARON&rsquo;S EMBASSY.</span></h2>
<p>I was following the Vice-Warden, but, on
second thoughts, went after my Lady, being
curious to see how she would manage to keep
the children out of sight.</p>
<p>I found her holding Sylvie&rsquo;s hand, and
with her other hand stroking Bruno&rsquo;s hair
in a most tender and motherly fashion: both
children were looking bewildered and half-frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own darlings,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been planning a little treat for you! The
Professor shall take you a long walk into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
woods this beautiful evening: and you shall
take a basket of food with you, and have a
little picnic down by the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno jumped, and clapped his hands. &ldquo;That
<i>are</i> nice!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t it, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie, who hadn&rsquo;t quite lost her surprised
look, put up her mouth for a kiss. &ldquo;Thank
you <i>very</i> much,&rdquo; she said earnestly.</p>
<p>My Lady turned her head away to conceal
the broad grin of triumph that spread
over her vast face, like a ripple on a
lake. &ldquo;Little simpletons!&rdquo; she muttered to
herself, as she marched up to the house. I
followed her in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, your Excellency,&rdquo; the Baron was
saying as we entered the Library. &ldquo;All the
infantry were under <i>my</i> command.&rdquo; He turned,
and was duly presented to my Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>military</i> hero?&rdquo; said my Lady. The fat
little man simpered. &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he replied,
modestly casting down his eyes. &ldquo;My ancestors
were all famous for military genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lady smiled graciously. &ldquo;It often runs
in families,&rdquo; she remarked: &ldquo;just as a love for
pastry does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The Baron looked slightly offended, and the
Vice-Warden discreetly changed the subject.
&ldquo;Dinner will soon be ready,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May
I have the honour of conducting your Adiposity
to the guest-chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly!&rdquo; the Baron eagerly
assented. &ldquo;It would never do to keep <i>dinner</i>
waiting!&rdquo; And he almost trotted out of the
room after the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>He was back again so speedily that the Vice-Warden
had barely time to explain to my Lady
that her remark about &ldquo;a love for pastry&rdquo; was
&ldquo;unfortunate. You might have seen, with
half an eye,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that that&rsquo;s <i>his</i> line.
Military genius, indeed! Pooh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner ready yet?&rdquo; the Baron enquired, as
he hurried into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will be in a few minutes,&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
replied. &ldquo;Meanwhile, let&rsquo;s take a turn in the
garden. You were telling me,&rdquo; he continued,
as the trio left the house, &ldquo;something about a
great battle in which you had the command
of the infantry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Baron. &ldquo;The enemy, as I
was saying, far outnumbered us: but I marched
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
my men right into the middle of&mdash;what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; the Military Hero exclaimed in agitated
tones, drawing back behind the Vice-Warden,
as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them,
brandishing a spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the Gardener!&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
replied in an encouraging tone. &ldquo;Quite harmless,
I assure you. Hark, he&rsquo;s singing! It&rsquo;s
his favorite amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once more those shrill discordant tones
rang out:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw a Banker&rsquo;s Clerk</p>
<p class="t">Descending from the bus:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Hippopotamus:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;If this should stay to dine,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;There won&rsquo;t be much for us!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Throwing away the spade, he broke into a
frantic jig, snapping his fingers, and repeating,
again and again</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be much for us!</p>
<p class="t0">There won&rsquo;t be much for us!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="center small">&lsquo;IT WAS A HIPPOPOTAMUS&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Once more the Baron looked slightly offended,
but the Vice-Warden hastily explained that the
song had no allusion to <i>him</i>, and in fact had no
meaning at all. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean anything by
it, now <i>did</i> you?&rdquo; He appealed to the Gardener,
who had finished his song, and stood,
balancing himself on one leg, and looking at
them, with his mouth open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never means nothing,&rdquo; said the Gardener:
and Uggug luckily came up at the moment,
and gave the conversation a new turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to present my son,&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden;
adding, in a whisper, &ldquo;one of the best
and cleverest boys that ever lived! I&rsquo;ll contrive
for you to see some of his cleverness. He
knows everything that other boys <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know;
and in archery, in fishing, in painting, and in
music, his skill is&mdash;but you shall judge for
yourself. You see that target over there? He
shall shoot an arrow at it. Dear boy,&rdquo; he went
on aloud, &ldquo;his Adiposity would like to see you
shoot. Bring his Highness&rsquo; bow and arrows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uggug looked very sulky as he received the
bow and arrow, and prepared to shoot. Just as
the arrow left the bow, the Vice-Warden trod
heavily on the toe of the Baron, who yelled
with the pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand pardons!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I
stepped back in my excitement. See! It is a
bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron gazed in astonishment. &ldquo;He held
the bow so awkwardly, it seemed impossible!&rdquo;
he muttered. But there was no room for doubt:
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
there was the arrow, right in the centre of the
bull&rsquo;s-eye!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lake is close by,&rdquo; continued the Vice-Warden.
&ldquo;Bring his Highness&rsquo; fishing-rod!&rdquo;
And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod, and
dangled the fly over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beetle on your arm!&rdquo; cried my Lady,
pinching the poor Baron&rsquo;s arm worse than if
ten lobsters had seized it at once. &ldquo;<i>That</i> kind
is poisonous,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But <i>what</i> a
pity! You missed seeing the fish pulled out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the
bank, with the hook in its mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had always fancied,&rdquo; the Baron faltered,
&ldquo;that cod were <i>salt</i>-water fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in <i>this</i> country,&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden.
&ldquo;Shall we go in? Ask my son some question
on the way&mdash;<i>any</i> subject you like!&rdquo; And the
sulky boy was violently shoved forwards, to
walk at the Baron&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could your Highness tell me,&rdquo; the Baron
cautiously began, &ldquo;how much seven times nine
would come to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn to the left!&rdquo; cried the Vice-Warden,
hastily stepping forwards to show the way&mdash;so
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate
guest, who fell heavily on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>So</i> sorry!&rdquo; my Lady exclaimed, as she and
her husband helped him to his feet again. &ldquo;My
son was in the act of saying &lsquo;sixty-three&rsquo; as
you fell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron said nothing: he was covered
with dust, and seemed much hurt, both in body
and mind. However, when they had got him
into the house, and given him a good brushing,
matters looked a little better.</p>
<p>Dinner was served in due course, and every
fresh dish seemed to increase the good-humour
of the Baron: but all efforts, to get him to
express his opinion as to Uggug&rsquo;s cleverness,
were in vain, until that interesting youth had
left the room, and was seen from the open
window, prowling about the lawn with a little
basket, which he was filling with frogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So fond of Natural History as he is, dear
boy!&rdquo; said the doting mother. &ldquo;Now <i>do</i> tell
us, Baron, what you think of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be perfectly candid,&rdquo; said the cautious
Baron, &ldquo;I would like a <i>little</i> more evidence.
I think you mentioned his skill in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Music?&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden. &ldquo;Why,
he&rsquo;s simply a prodigy! You shall hear him
play the piano.&rdquo; And he walked to the window.
&ldquo;Ug&mdash;&mdash;I mean my boy! Come in for
a minute, <i>and bring the music-master with you</i>!
To turn over the music for him,&rdquo; he added as
an explanation.</p>
<p>Uggug, having filled his basket with frogs,
had no objection to obey, and soon appeared
in the room, followed by a fierce-looking little
man, who asked the Vice-Warden &ldquo;Vot music
vill you haf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sonata that His Highness plays so
charmingly,&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Highness haf not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the music-master
began, but was sharply stopped by the
Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, Sir! Go and turn over the music
for his Highness. My dear,&rdquo; (to the Wardeness)
&ldquo;will you show him what to do?
And meanwhile, Baron, I&rsquo;ll just show you a
most interesting map we have&mdash;of Outland,
and Fairyland, and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/i096.jpg" alt="THE MAP OF FAIRYLAND" width="500" height="331" />
<p class="center small">THE MAP OF FAIRYLAND</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>By the time my Lady had returned, from
explaining things to the music-master, the map
had been hung up, and the Baron was already
much bewildered by the Vice-Warden&rsquo;s habit
of pointing to one place while he shouted out
the name of another.</p>
<p>My Lady joining in, pointing out other places,
and shouting other names, only made matters
worse; and at last the Baron, in despair,
took to pointing out places for himself, and
feebly asked &ldquo;Is that great yellow splotch
<i>Fairyland</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Fairyland,&rdquo; said the Vice-Warden:
&ldquo;and you might as well give him a
hint,&rdquo; he muttered to my Lady, &ldquo;about going
back to-morrow. He eats like a shark! It
would hardly do for <i>me</i> to mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife caught the idea, and at once began
giving hints of the most subtle and delicate
kind. &ldquo;Just see what a short way it is back
to Fairyland! Why, if you started to-morrow
morning, you&rsquo;d get there in very little more
than a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron looked incredulous. &ldquo;It took
me a full month to <i>come</i>,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s ever so much shorter, going <i>back</i>,
you know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The Baron looked appealingly to the Vice-Warden,
who chimed in readily. &ldquo;You can go
back <i>five</i> times, in the time it took you to come
here <i>once</i>&mdash;if you start to-morrow morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time the Sonata was pealing through
the room. The Baron could not help admitting
to himself that it was being magnificently
played: but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of
the youthful performer. Every time he had
nearly succeeded in catching sight of him, either
the Vice-Warden or his wife was sure to get in
the way, pointing out some new place on the
map, and deafening him with some new name.</p>
<p>He gave in at last, wished a hasty good-night,
and left the room, while his host and
hostess interchanged looks of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deftly done!&rdquo; cried the Vice-Warden.
&ldquo;Craftily contrived! But what means all that
tramping on the stairs?&rdquo; He half-opened the
door, looked out, and added in a tone of dismay,
&ldquo;The Baron&rsquo;s boxes are being carried down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what means all that rumbling of
wheels?&rdquo; cried my Lady. She peeped through
the window curtains. &ldquo;The Baron&rsquo;s carriage
has come round!&rdquo; she groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>At this moment the door opened: a fat,
furious face looked in: a voice, hoarse with
passion, thundered out the words &ldquo;My room is
full of frogs&mdash;I leave you!&rdquo;: and the door
closed again.</p>
<p>And still the noble Sonata went pealing
through the room: but it was <i>Arthur&rsquo;s</i> masterly
touch that roused the echoes, and thrilled
my very soul with the tender music of the
immortal &lsquo;Sonata Pathetique&rsquo;: and it was not
till the last note had died away that the tired
but happy traveler could bring himself to
utter the words &ldquo;good-night!&rdquo; and to seek his
much-needed pillow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">A RIDE ON A LION.</span></h2>
<p>The next day glided away, pleasantly
enough, partly in settling myself in my new
quarters, and partly in strolling round the
neighbourhood, under Arthur&rsquo;s guidance, and
trying to form a general idea of Elveston and
its inhabitants. When five o&rsquo;clock arrived,
Arthur proposed&mdash;without any embarrassment
this time&mdash;to take me with him up to &lsquo;the
Hall,&rsquo; in order that I might make acquaintance
with the Earl of Ainslie, who had taken it for
the season, and renew acquaintance with his
daughter Lady Muriel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>My first impressions of the gentle, dignified,
and yet genial old man were entirely favourable:
and the <i>real</i> satisfaction that showed
itself on his daughter&rsquo;s face, as she met me with
the words &ldquo;this is indeed an unlooked-for
pleasure!&rdquo;, was very soothing for whatever
remains of personal vanity the failures and
disappointments of many long years, and much
buffeting with a rough world, had left in me.</p>
<p>Yet I noted, and was glad to note, evidence
of a far deeper feeling than mere friendly
regard, in her meeting with Arthur&mdash;though
this was, as I gathered, an almost daily occurrence&mdash;and
the conversation between them, in
which the Earl and I were only occasional
sharers, had an ease and a spontaneity rarely
met with except between <i>very</i> old friends: and,
as I knew that they had not known each other
for a longer period than the summer which
was now rounding into autumn, I felt certain
that &lsquo;Love,&rsquo; and Love alone, could explain the
phenomenon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How convenient it would be,&rdquo; Lady Muriel
laughingly remarked, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of my having insisted
on saving her the trouble of carrying a
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
cup of tea across the room to the Earl, &ldquo;if
cups of tea had no weight at all! Then perhaps
ladies would <i>sometimes</i> be permitted to
carry them for short distances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can easily imagine a situation,&rdquo; said
Arthur, &ldquo;where things would <i>necessarily</i> have
no weight, relatively to each other, though each
would have its usual weight, looked at by
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some desperate paradox!&rdquo; said the Earl.
&ldquo;Tell us how it could be. We shall never
guess it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose this house, just as it is,
placed a few billion miles above a planet, and
with nothing else near enough to disturb it: of
course it falls <i>to</i> the planet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl nodded. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;though it
might take some centuries to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is five-o&rsquo;clock-tea to be going on all
the while?&rdquo; said Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, and other things,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;The
inhabitants would live their lives, grow up and
die, and still the house would be falling, falling,
falling! But now as to the relative weight of
things. Nothing can be <i>heavy</i>, you know,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
except by <i>trying</i> to fall, and being prevented
from doing so. You all grant that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all granted that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, if I take this book, and hold it
out at arms length, of course I feel its <i>weight</i>.
It is trying to fall, and I prevent it. And, if I
let go, it falls to the floor. But, if we were all
falling together, it couldn&rsquo;t be <i>trying</i> to fall any
quicker, you know: for, if I let go, what more
could it do than fall? And, as my hand would
be falling too&mdash;at the same rate&mdash;it would
never leave it, for that would be to get ahead of
it in the race. And it could never overtake the
falling floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it clearly,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;But
it makes one dizzy to think of such things!
How <i>can</i> you make us do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a more curious idea yet,&rdquo; I ventured
to say. &ldquo;Suppose a cord fastened to the
house, from below, and pulled down by some
one on the planet. Then of course the <i>house</i>
goes faster than its natural rate of falling: but
the furniture&mdash;with our noble selves&mdash;would
go on falling at their old pace, and would
therefore be left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Practically, we should rise to the ceiling,&rdquo;
said the Earl. &ldquo;The inevitable result of which
would be concussion of brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To avoid that,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;let us have
the furniture fixed to the floor, and ourselves
tied down to the furniture. Then the five-o&rsquo;clock-tea
could go on in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With one little drawback!&rdquo; Lady Muriel
gaily interrupted. &ldquo;We should take the <i>cups</i>
down with us: but what about the <i>tea</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten the <i>tea</i>,&rdquo; Arthur confessed.
&ldquo;<i>That</i>, no doubt, would rise to the ceiling&mdash;unless
you chose to drink it on the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which, I think, is <i>quite</i> nonsense enough
for one while!&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;What news
does this gentleman bring us from the great
world of London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This drew <i>me</i> into the conversation, which
now took a more conventional tone. After a
while, Arthur gave the signal for our departure,
and in the cool of the evening we strolled
down to the beach, enjoying the silence, broken
only by the murmur of the sea and the far-away
music of some fishermen&rsquo;s song, almost as much
as our late pleasant talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>We sat down among the rocks, by a little
pool, so rich in animal, vegetable, and zo&ouml;phytic&mdash;or
whatever is the right word&mdash;life, that I
became entranced in the study of it, and, when
Arthur proposed returning to our lodgings, I
begged to be left there for a while, to watch and
muse alone.</p>
<p>The fishermen&rsquo;s song grew ever nearer and
clearer, as their boat stood in for the beach;
and I would have gone down to see them land
their cargo of fish, had not the microcosm at
my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly.</p>
<p>One ancient crab, that was for ever shuffling
frantically from side to side of the pool, had
particularly fascinated me: there was a vacancy
in its stare, and an aimless violence in its
behaviour, that irresistibly recalled the Gardener
who had befriended Sylvie and Bruno:
and, as I gazed, I caught the concluding notes
of the tune of his crazy song.</p>
<p>The silence that followed was broken by the
sweet voice of Sylvie. &ldquo;Would you please let
us out into the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! After that old beggar again?&rdquo; the
Gardener yelled, and began singing:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw a Kangaroo</p>
<p class="t">That worked a coffee-mill:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Vegetable-Pill.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Were I to swallow this,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;I should be very ill!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want him to swallow <i>anything</i>,&rdquo;
Sylvie explained. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not hungry. But we
want to see him. So will you please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i106.jpg" alt="&lsquo;HE THOUGHT HE SAW A KANGAROO&rsquo;" width="500" height="481" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;HE THOUGHT HE SAW A KANGAROO&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; the Gardener promptly replied.
&ldquo;I <i>always</i> please. Never displeases nobody.
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
There you are!&rdquo; And he flung the door open,
and let us out upon the dusty high-road.</p>
<p>We soon found our way to the bush, which
had so mysteriously sunk into the ground: and
here Sylvie drew the Magic Locket from its
hiding-place, turned it over with a thoughtful
air, and at last appealed to Bruno in a rather
helpless way. &ldquo;What <i>was</i> it we had to do with
it, Bruno? It&rsquo;s all gone out of my head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss it!&rdquo; was Bruno&rsquo;s invariable recipe in
cases of doubt and difficulty. Sylvie kissed it,
but no result followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rub it the wrong way,&rdquo; was Bruno&rsquo;s next
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which <i>is</i> the wrong way?&rdquo; Sylvie most
reasonably enquired. The obvious plan was to
try <i>both</i> ways.</p>
<p>Rubbing from left to right had no visible
effect whatever.</p>
<p>From right to left&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, stop, Sylvie!&rdquo;
Bruno cried in sudden alarm. &ldquo;Whatever <i>is</i>
going to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a number of trees, on the neighbouring
hillside, were moving slowly upwards, in solemn
procession: while a mild little brook, that had
been rippling at our feet a moment before,
began to swell, and foam, and hiss, and bubble,
in a truly alarming fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i108.jpg" alt="THE MOUSE-LION" width="500" height="321" />
<p class="center small">THE MOUSE-LION</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rub it some other way!&rdquo; cried Bruno.
&ldquo;Try up-and-down! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a happy thought. Up-and-down did
it: and the landscape, which had been showing
signs of mental aberration in various directions,
returned to its normal condition of sobriety&mdash;with
the exception of a small yellowish-brown
mouse, which continued to run wildly up and
down the road, lashing its tail like a little lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow it,&rdquo; said Sylvie: and this also
turned out a happy thought. The mouse at
once settled down into a business-like jog-trot,
with which we could easily keep pace. The
only phenomenon, that gave me any uneasiness,
was the rapid increase in the <i>size</i> of the little
creature we were following, which became
every moment more and more like a real lion.</p>
<p>Soon the transformation was complete: and
a noble lion stood patiently waiting for us to
come up with it. No thought of fear seemed to
occur to the children, who patted and stroked
it as if it had been a Shetland-pony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help me up!&rdquo; cried Bruno. And in another
moment Sylvie had lifted him upon the broad
back of the gentle beast, and seated herself
behind him, pillion-fashion. Bruno took a good
handful of mane in each hand, and made believe
to guide this new kind of steed. &ldquo;Gee-up!&rdquo;
seemed quite sufficient by way of <i>verbal</i> direction:
the lion at once broke into an easy canter,
and we soon found ourselves in the depths
of the forest. I say &lsquo;<i>we</i>,&rsquo; for I am certain
that <i>I</i> accompanied them&mdash;though <i>how</i> I
managed to keep up with a cantering lion I am
wholly unable to explain. But I was certainly
one of the party when we came upon an old
beggar-man cutting sticks, at whose feet the
lion made a profound obeisance, Sylvie and
Bruno at the same moment dismounting, and
leaping into the arms of their father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From bad to worse!&rdquo; the old man said to
himself, dreamily, when the children had
finished their rather confused account of the
Ambassador&rsquo;s visit, gathered no doubt from
general report, as they had not seen him themselves.
&ldquo;From bad to worse! That is their
destiny. I see it, but I cannot alter it. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
selfishness of a mean and crafty man&mdash;the
selfishness of an ambitious and silly woman&mdash;the
selfishness of a spiteful and loveless child&mdash;all
tend one way, from bad to worse! And
you, my darlings, must suffer it awhile, I fear.
Yet, when things are at their worst, you can
come to me. I can do but little as yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gathering up a handful of dust and scattering
it in the air, he slowly and solemnly pronounced
some words that sounded like a charm, the
children looking on in awe-struck silence:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let craft, ambition, spite,</p>
<p class="t0">Be quenched in Reason&rsquo;s night,</p>
<p class="t0">Till weakness turn to might,</p>
<p class="t0">Till what is dark be light,</p>
<p class="t0">Till what is wrong be right!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The cloud of dust spread itself out through
the air, as if it were alive, forming curious
shapes that were for ever changing into others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes letters! It makes words!&rdquo;
Bruno whispered, as he clung, half-frightened,
to Sylvie. &ldquo;Only I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> make them out!
Read them, Sylvie!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; Sylvie gravely replied. &ldquo;Wait a
minute&mdash;if only I could see that word&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very ill!&rdquo; a discordant voice
yelled in our ears.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Were I to swallow this,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;I should be very ill!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">A JESTER AND A BEAR.</span></h2>
<p>Yes, we were in the garden once more: and,
to escape that horrid discordant voice, we
hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the
library&mdash;Uggug blubbering, the Professor
standing by with a bewildered air, and my
Lady, with her arms clasped round her son&rsquo;s
neck, repeating, over and over again, &ldquo;and <i>did</i>
they give him nasty lessons to learn? My
own pretty pet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this noise about?&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
angrily enquired, as he strode into the
room. &ldquo;And who put the hat-stand here?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
And he hung his hat up on Bruno, who was
standing in the middle of the room, too much
astonished by the sudden change of scene to
make any attempt at removing it, though it
came down to his shoulders, making him look
something like a small candle with a large
extinguisher over it.</p>
<p>The Professor mildly explained that His
Highness had been graciously pleased to say
he wouldn&rsquo;t do his lessons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your lessons this instant, you young
cub!&rdquo; thundered the Vice-Warden. &ldquo;And
take <i>this</i>!&rdquo; and a resounding box on the ear
made the unfortunate Professor reel across
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; faltered the poor old man, as
he sank, half-fainting, at my Lady&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shave you? Of course I will!&rdquo; my Lady
replied, as she lifted him into a chair, and
pinned an anti-macassar round his neck.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the razor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden meanwhile had got hold
of Uggug, and was belabouring him with his
umbrella. &ldquo;Who left this loose nail in the
floor?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Hammer it in, I say!
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Hammer it in!&rdquo; Blow after blow fell on the
writhing Uggug, till he dropped howling to
the floor.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i115.jpg" alt="&lsquo;HAMMER IT IN!&rsquo;" width="500" height="564" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;HAMMER IT IN!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then his father turned to the &lsquo;shaving&rsquo;
scene which was being enacted, and roared
with laughter. &ldquo;Excuse me, dear, I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help
it!&rdquo; he said as soon as he could speak. &ldquo;You
<i>are</i> such an utter donkey! Kiss me, Tabby!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>And he flung his arms round the neck of the
terrified Professor, who raised a wild shriek,
but whether he received the threatened kiss or
not I was unable to see, as Bruno, who had by
this time released himself from his extinguisher,
rushed headlong out of the room, followed by
Sylvie; and I was so fearful of being left alone
among all these crazy creatures that I hurried
after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go to Father!&rdquo; Sylvie panted, as
they ran down the garden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> things
are at their worst! I&rsquo;ll ask the Gardener to
let us out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>walk</i> all the way!&rdquo; Bruno
whimpered. &ldquo;How I <i>wiss</i> we had a coach-and-four,
like Uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, shrill and wild, rang through the air the
familiar voice:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four</p>
<p class="t">That stood beside his bed:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Bear without a Head.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Poor thing,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;poor silly thing!</p>
<p class="t">It&rsquo;s waiting to be fed!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/i117.jpg" alt="A BEAR WITHOUT A HEAD" width="500" height="608" />
<p class="center small">A BEAR WITHOUT A HEAD</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let you out again!&rdquo; he said,
before the children could speak. &ldquo;The Vice-Warden
gave it me, he did, for letting you
out last time! So be off with you!&rdquo; And,
turning away from them, he began digging
frantically in the middle of a gravel-walk,
singing, over and over again,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor thing,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;poor silly thing!</p>
<p class="t">It&rsquo;s waiting to be fed!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>but in a more musical tone than the shrill
screech in which he had begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The music grew fuller and richer at every
moment: other manly voices joined in the
refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that
told me the boat had touched the beach, and
the harsh grating of the shingle as the men
dragged it up. I roused myself, and, after
lending them a hand in hauling up their boat,
I lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark
a goodly assortment of the hard-won &lsquo;treasures
of the deep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When at last I reached our lodgings I was
tired and sleepy, and glad enough to settle
down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur
hospitably went to his cupboard, to get me
out some cake and wine, without which, he
declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit
my going to bed.</p>
<p>And how that cupboard-door <i>did</i> creak! It
surely could not be <i>Arthur</i>, who was opening
and shutting it so often, moving so restlessly
about, and muttering like the soliloquy of a
tragedy-queen!</p>
<p>No, it was a <i>female</i> voice. Also the figure&mdash;half-hidden
by the cupboard-door&mdash;was a
<i>female</i> figure, massive, and in flowing robes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
Could it be the landlady? The door opened,
and a strange man entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> that donkey doing?&rdquo; he said to
himself, pausing, aghast, on the threshold.</p>
<p>The lady, thus rudely referred to, was his
wife. She had got one of the cupboards open,
and stood with her back to him, smoothing
down a sheet of brown paper on one of the
shelves, and whispering to herself &ldquo;So, so!
Deftly done! Craftily contrived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe,
and tapped her on the head. &ldquo;Boh!&rdquo; he
playfully shouted at her ear. &ldquo;Never tell me
again I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say &lsquo;boh&rsquo; to a goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lady wrung her hands. &ldquo;Discovered!&rdquo;
she groaned. &ldquo;Yet no&mdash;he is one of us!
Reveal it not, oh Man! Let it bide its time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reveal <i>what</i> not?&rdquo; her husband testily
replied, dragging out the sheet of brown paper.
&ldquo;What are you hiding here, my Lady? I
insist upon knowing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lady cast down her eyes, and spoke in
the littlest of little voices. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make fun of
it, Benjamin!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you understand? It&rsquo;s a <span class="small">DAGGER</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s <i>that</i> for?&rdquo; sneered His Excellency.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only got to make people <i>think</i>
he&rsquo;s dead! We haven&rsquo;t got to <i>kill</i> him! And
made of tin, too!&rdquo; he snarled, contemptuously
bending the blade round his thumb. &ldquo;Now,
Madam, you&rsquo;ll be good enough to explain.
First, what do you call me <i>Benjamin</i> for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the Conspiracy, Love! One
<i>must</i> have an alias, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an <i>alias</i>, is it? Well! And next,
what did you get this dagger for? Come, no
evasions! You ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t deceive <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it for&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the detected
Conspirator stammered, trying her best to put
on the assassin-expression that she had been
practising at the looking-glass. &ldquo;For&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>what</i>, Madam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for eighteenpence, if you <i>must</i> know,
dearest! That&rsquo;s what I got it for, on my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now <i>don&rsquo;t</i> say your Word and Honour!&rdquo;
groaned the other Conspirator. &ldquo;Why, they
aren&rsquo;t worth half the money, put together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my <i>birthday</i>,&rdquo; my Lady concluded in a
meek whisper. &ldquo;One <i>must</i> have a dagger, you
know. It&rsquo;s part of the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk of Conspiracies!&rdquo; her husband
savagely interrupted, as he tossed the
dagger into the cupboard. &ldquo;You know about
as much how to manage a Conspiracy as if
you were a chicken. Why, the first thing is
to get a disguise. Now, just look at this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with pardonable pride he fitted on the
cap and bells, and the rest of the Fool&rsquo;s dress,
and winked at her, and put his tongue in his
cheek. &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> the sort of thing, now?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>My Lady&rsquo;s eyes flashed with all a Conspirator&rsquo;s
enthusiasm. &ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, clapping her hands. &ldquo;You do look,
oh, such a <i>perfect</i> Fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fool smiled a doubtful smile. He was
not quite clear whether it was a compliment
or not, to express it so plainly. &ldquo;You mean
a Jester? Yes, that&rsquo;s what I intended. And
what do you think <i>your</i> disguise is to be?&rdquo;
And he proceeded to unfold the parcel, the
lady watching him in rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely!&rdquo; she cried, when at last
the dress was unfolded. &ldquo;What a <i>splendid</i>
disguise! An Esquimaux peasant-woman!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;An Esquimaux peasant, indeed!&rdquo; growled
the other. &ldquo;Here, put it on, and look at yourself
in the glass. Why, it&rsquo;s a <i>Bear</i>, ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you
use your eyes?&rdquo; He checked himself suddenly,
as a harsh voice yelled through the room</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Bear without a Head!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But it was only the Gardener, singing under
the open window. The Vice-Warden stole on
tip-toe to the window, and closed it noiselessly,
before he ventured to go on. &ldquo;Yes, Lovey, a
<i>Bear</i>: but not without a <i>head</i>, I hope! You&rsquo;re
the Bear, and me the Keeper. And if any one
knows us, they&rsquo;ll have sharp eyes, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to practise the steps a bit,&rdquo; my
Lady said, looking out through the Bear&rsquo;s
mouth: &ldquo;one ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help being rather human
just at first, you know. And of course you&rsquo;ll
say &lsquo;Come up, Bruin!&rsquo;, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; replied the Keeper, laying
hold of the chain, that hung from the Bear&rsquo;s
collar, with one hand, while with the other he
cracked a little whip. &ldquo;Now go round the
room in a sort of a dancing attitude. Very
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
good, my dear, very good. Come up, Bruin!
Come up, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" alt="&lsquo;COME UP, BRUIN!&rsquo;" width="500" height="471" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;COME UP, BRUIN!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He roared out the last words for the benefit
of Uggug, who had just come into the room,
and was now standing, with his hands spread
out, and eyes and mouth wide open, the very
picture of stupid amazement. &ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; was
all he could gasp out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The Keeper pretended to be adjusting the
bear&rsquo;s collar, which gave him an opportunity of
whispering, unheard by Uggug, &ldquo;<i>my</i> fault, I&rsquo;m
afraid! Quite forgot to fasten the door. Plot&rsquo;s
ruined if <i>he</i> finds it out! Keep it up a minute
or two longer. Be savage!&rdquo; Then, while
seeming to pull it back with all his strength, he
let it advance upon the scared boy: my Lady,
with admirable presence of mind, kept up what
she no doubt intended for a savage growl,
though it was more like the purring of a cat:
and Uggug backed out of the room with such
haste that he tripped over the mat, and was
heard to fall heavily outside&mdash;an accident
to which even his doting mother paid no heed,
in the excitement of the moment.</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden shut and bolted the door.
&ldquo;Off with the disguises!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
not a moment to lose. He&rsquo;s sure to fetch the
Professor, and we couldn&rsquo;t take <i>him</i> in, you
know!&rdquo; And in another minute the disguises
were stowed away in the cupboard, the door
unbolted, and the two Conspirators seated
lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly
discussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
snatched off the table, which proved to be the
City-Directory of the capital of Outland.</p>
<p>The door opened, very slowly and cautiously,
and the Professor peeped in, Uggug&rsquo;s stupid
face being just visible behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful arrangement!&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
was saying with enthusiasm. &ldquo;You
see, my precious one, that there are fifteen
houses in Green Street, <i>before</i> you turn into
West Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fifteen</i> houses! Is it <i>possible</i>?&rdquo; my Lady
replied. &ldquo;I thought it was fourteen!&rdquo; And,
so intent were they on this interesting question,
that neither of them even looked up till the
Professor, leading Uggug by the hand, stood
close before them.</p>
<p>My Lady was the first to notice their approach.
&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the Professor!&rdquo; she
exclaimed in her blandest tones. &ldquo;And my
precious child too! Are lessons over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange thing has happened!&rdquo; the Professor
began in a trembling tone. &ldquo;His Exalted
Fatness&rdquo; (this was one of Uggug&rsquo;s many titles)
&ldquo;tells me he has just seen, in this very room,
a Dancing-Bear and a Court-Jester!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The Vice-Warden and his wife shook with
well-acted merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in <i>this</i> room, darling!&rdquo; said the fond
mother. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been sitting here this hour
or more, reading&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; here she referred to
the book lying on her lap, &ldquo;&mdash;reading the&mdash;the
City-Directory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me feel your pulse, my boy!&rdquo; said the
anxious father. &ldquo;Now put out your tongue.
Ah, I thought so! He&rsquo;s a little feverish, Professor,
and has had a bad dream. Put him to
bed at once, and give him a cooling draught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been dreaming!&rdquo; his Exalted Fatness
remonstrated, as the Professor led him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad grammar, Sir!&rdquo; his father remarked
with some sternness. &ldquo;Kindly attend to <i>that</i>
little matter, Professor, as soon as you have
corrected the feverishness. And, by the way,
Professor!&rdquo; (The Professor left his distinguished
pupil standing at the door, and meekly
returned.) &ldquo;There is a rumour afloat, that the
people wish to elect an&mdash;in point of fact, an&mdash;you
understand that I mean an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>another Professor</i>!&rdquo; the poor old man
exclaimed in horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! Certainly not!&rdquo; the Vice-Warden
eagerly explained. &ldquo;Merely an <i>Emperor</i>, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An <i>Emperor</i>!&rdquo; cried the astonished Professor,
holding his head between his hands, as
if he expected it to come to pieces with the
shock. &ldquo;What will the Warden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the <i>Warden</i> will most likely <i>be</i> the
new Emperor!&rdquo; my Lady explained. &ldquo;Where
could we find a better? Unless, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
she glanced at her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where indeed!&rdquo; the Professor fervently
responded, quite failing to take the hint.</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden resumed the thread of his
discourse. &ldquo;The reason I mentioned it, Professor,
was to ask <i>you</i> to be so kind as to
preside at the Election. You see it would
make the thing <i>respectable</i>&mdash;no suspicion of
anything underhand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, your Excellency!&rdquo; the old
man faltered. &ldquo;What will the Warden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; the Vice-Warden interrupted.
&ldquo;Your position, as Court-Professor, makes it
awkward, I admit. Well, well! Then the
Election shall be held without you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better so, than if it were held <i>within</i> me!&rdquo;
the Professor murmured with a bewildered air,
as if he hardly knew what he was saying.
&ldquo;Bed, I think your Highness said, and a cooling-draught?&rdquo;
And he wandered dreamily
back to where Uggug sulkily awaited him.</p>
<p>I followed them out of the room, and down
the passage, the Professor murmuring to himself,
all the time, as a kind of aid to his feeble
memory, &ldquo;C, C, C; Couch, Cooling-Draught,
Correct-Grammar,&rdquo; till, in turning a corner,
he met Sylvie and Bruno, so suddenly that
the startled Professor let go of his fat pupil,
who instantly took to his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We were looking for you!&rdquo; cried Sylvie,
in a tone of great relief. &ldquo;We <i>do</i> want you
so much, you ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear children?&rdquo; the Professor
asked, beaming on them with a very different
look from what Uggug ever got from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to speak to the Gardener for
us,&rdquo; Sylvie said, as she and Bruno took the old
man&rsquo;s hands and led him into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ever so unkind!&rdquo; Bruno mournfully
added. &ldquo;They&rsquo;s <i>all</i> unkind to us, now that
Father&rsquo;s gone. The Lion were <i>much</i> nicer!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you must explain to me, please,&rdquo; the
Professor said with an anxious look, &ldquo;<i>which</i>
is the Lion, and <i>which</i> is the Gardener. It&rsquo;s
<i>most</i> important not to get two such animals
confused together. And one&rsquo;s very liable to
do it in their case&mdash;both having mouths,
you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doos oo <i>always</i> confuses two animals together?&rdquo;
Bruno asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty often, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the Professor candidly
confessed. &ldquo;Now, for instance, there&rsquo;s
the rabbit-hutch and the hall-clock.&rdquo; The Professor
pointed them out. &ldquo;One gets a little
confused with <i>them</i>&mdash;both having doors, you
know. Now, only yesterday&mdash;would you believe
it?&mdash;I put some lettuces into the clock,
and tried to wind up the rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the rabbit <i>go</i>, after oo wounded it
up?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>The Professor clasped his hands on the top
of his head, and groaned. &ldquo;Go? I should
think it <i>did</i> go! Why, it&rsquo;s <i>gone</i>! And where
ever it&rsquo;s gone to&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> find out!
I&rsquo;ve done my best&mdash;I&rsquo;ve read all the article
&lsquo;Rabbit&rsquo; in the great dictionary&mdash;&mdash; Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only the tailor, Sir, with your little bill,&rdquo;
said a meek voice outside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I can soon settle <i>his</i> business,&rdquo;
the Professor said to the children, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
just wait a minute. How much is it, this year,
my man?&rdquo; The tailor had come in while he
was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been a doubling so many years,
you see,&rdquo; the tailor replied, a little gruffly, &ldquo;and
I think I&rsquo;d like the money now. It&rsquo;s two
thousand pound, it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; the Professor carelessly
remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he
always carried at least <i>that</i> amount about with
him. &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you like to wait just
another year, and make it <i>four</i> thousand?
Just think how rich you&rsquo;d be! Why, you
might be a <i>King</i>, if you liked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d care about being a
<i>King</i>,&rdquo; the man said thoughtfully. &ldquo;But it
<i>dew</i> sound a powerful sight o&rsquo; money! Well,
I think I&rsquo;ll wait&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will!&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s good sense in <i>you</i>, I see. Good-day
to you, my man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ever have to pay him that four
thousand pounds?&rdquo; Sylvie asked as the door
closed on the departing creditor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Never</i>, my child!&rdquo; the Professor replied
emphatically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go on doubling it, till
he dies. You see it&rsquo;s <i>always</i> worth while
waiting another year, to get twice as much
money! And now what would you like to
do, my little friends? Shall I take you to see
the Other Professor? This would be an excellent
opportunity for a visit,&ldquo; he said to himself,
glancing at his watch: &ldquo;he generally takes
a short rest&mdash;of fourteen minutes and a half&mdash;about
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who
was standing at the other side of the Professor,
and put his hand into hers. &ldquo;I <i>thinks</i> we&rsquo;d
like to go,&rdquo; he said doubtfully: &ldquo;only please
let&rsquo;s go all together. It&rsquo;s best to be on the
safe side, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you talk as if you were <i>Sylvie</i>!&rdquo;
exclaimed the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; Bruno replied very humbly.
&ldquo;I quite forgotted I wasn&rsquo;t Sylvie. Only I
fought he might be rarver fierce!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The Professor laughed a jolly laugh. &ldquo;Oh,
he&rsquo;s quite tame!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He never bites.
He&rsquo;s only a little&mdash;a little <i>dreamy</i>, you know.&rdquo;
He took hold of Bruno&rsquo;s other hand, and led
the children down a long passage I had never
noticed before&mdash;not that there was anything
remarkable in <i>that</i>: I was constantly coming
on new rooms and passages in that mysterious
Palace, and very seldom succeeded in finding
the old ones again.</p>
<p>Near the end of the passage the Professor
stopped. &ldquo;This is his room,&rdquo; he said, pointing
to the solid wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get in through <i>there</i>!&rdquo; Bruno
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sylvie said nothing, till she had carefully
examined whether the wall opened anywhere.
Then she laughed merrily: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing
us a trick, you dear old thing!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no <i>door</i> here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any door to the room,&rdquo; said
the Professor. &ldquo;We shall have to climb in at
the window.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i134.jpg" alt="THE OTHER PROFESSOR" width="500" height="325" />
<p class="center small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>So we went into the garden, and soon
found the window of the Other Professor&rsquo;s
room. It was a ground-floor window, and
stood invitingly open: the Professor first
lifted the two children in, and then he and I
climbed in after them.</p>
<p>The Other Professor was seated at a table,
with a large book open before him, on which
his forehead was resting: he had clasped his
arms round the book, and was snoring heavily.
&ldquo;He usually reads like that,&rdquo; the Professor
remarked, &ldquo;when the book&rsquo;s very interesting:
and then sometimes it&rsquo;s very difficult to get
him to attend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to be one of the difficult times:
the Professor lifted him up, once or twice, and
shook him violently: but he always returned
to his book the moment he was let go of, and
showed by his heavy breathing that the book
was as interesting as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreamy he is!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed.
&ldquo;He must have got to a <i>very</i>
interesting part of the book!&rdquo; And he rained
quite a shower of thumps on the Other Professor&rsquo;s
back, shouting &ldquo;Hoy! Hoy!&rdquo; all the
time. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it <i>wonderful</i> that he should be
so dreamy?&rdquo; he said to Bruno.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s always as <i>sleepy</i> as that,&rdquo; Bruno
remarked, &ldquo;a <i>course</i> he&rsquo;s dreamy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we to <i>do</i>?&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;You see he&rsquo;s quite wrapped up in
the book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose oo <i>shuts</i> the book?&rdquo; Bruno suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried the delighted Professor.
&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; And he shut up the
book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor&rsquo;s
nose between the leaves, and gave it a
severe pinch.</p>
<p>The Other Professor instantly rose to his
feet, and carried the book away to the end of
the room, where he put it back in its place in
the book-case. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading for eighteen
hours and three-quarters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now
I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half.
Is the Lecture all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly,&rdquo; the Professor humbly replied.
&ldquo;I shall ask you to give me a hint or two&mdash;there
will be a few little difficulties&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a Banquet, I think you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! The Banquet comes <i>first</i>, of
course. People never enjoy Abstract Science,
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
you know, when they&rsquo;re ravenous with hunger.
And then there&rsquo;s the Fancy-Dress-Ball. Oh,
there&rsquo;ll be lots of entertainment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will the Ball come in?&rdquo; said the
Other Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>think</i> it had better come at the beginning
of the Banquet&mdash;it brings people together so
nicely, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the right order. First the Meeting:
then the Eating: then the Treating&mdash;for
I&rsquo;m sure any Lecture <i>you</i> give us will be a
treat!&rdquo; said the Other Professor, who had
been standing with his back to us all this time,
occupying himself in taking the books out, one
by one, and turning them upside-down. An
easel, with a black board on it, stood near
him: and, every time that he turned a book
upside-down, he made a mark on the board
with a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to the &lsquo;Pig-Tale&rsquo;&mdash;which <i>you</i>
have so kindly promised to give us&mdash;&rdquo; the
Professor went on, thoughtfully rubbing his
chin. &ldquo;I think that had better come at the
<i>end</i> of the Banquet: then people can listen to
it quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I <i>sing</i> it?&rdquo; the Other Professor asked,
with a smile of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you <i>can</i>,&rdquo; the Professor replied, cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; said the Other Professor,
seating himself at the pianoforte. &ldquo;For the
sake of argument, let us assume that it begins
on A flat.&rdquo; And he struck the note in question.
&ldquo;La, la, la! I think that&rsquo;s within an octave of
it.&rdquo; He struck the note again, and appealed to
Bruno, who was standing at his side. &ldquo;Did I
sing it like <i>that</i>, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oo didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bruno replied with great
decision. &ldquo;It were more like a duck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Single notes are apt to have that effect,&rdquo;
the Other Professor said with a sigh. &ldquo;Let
me try a whole verse.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was a Pig, that sat alone,</p>
<p class="t">Beside a ruined Pump.</p>
<p class="t0">By day and night he made his moan:</p>
<p class="t0">It would have stirred a heart of stone</p>
<p class="t0">To see him wring his hoofs and groan,</p>
<p class="t">Because he could not jump.</p>
</div>
<p>Would you call that a tune, Professor?&rdquo; he
asked, when he had finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The Professor considered a little. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he said at last, &ldquo;some of the notes are the
same as others&mdash;and some are different&mdash;but
I should hardly call it a <i>tune</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try it a bit by myself,&rdquo; said the
Other Professor. And he began touching the
notes here and there, and humming to himself
like an angry bluebottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like his singing?&rdquo; the Professor
asked the children in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very <i>beautiful</i>,&rdquo; Sylvie said,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very extremely <i>ugly</i>!&rdquo; Bruno said,
without any hesitation at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All extremes are bad,&rdquo; the Professor said,
very gravely. &ldquo;For instance, Sobriety is a
very good thing, when practised <i>in moderation</i>:
but even Sobriety, when carried to an <i>extreme</i>,
has its disadvantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are its disadvantages?&rdquo; was the
question that rose in my mind&mdash;and, as usual,
Bruno asked it for me. &ldquo;What <i>are</i> its lizard
bandages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is <i>one</i> of them,&rdquo; said the Professor.
&ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s tipsy (that&rsquo;s one extreme,
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
you know), he sees one thing as two.
But, when he&rsquo;s <i>extremely</i> sober (that&rsquo;s the other
extreme), he sees two things as one. It&rsquo;s
equally inconvenient, whichever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;illconvenient&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; Bruno
whispered to Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difference between &lsquo;convenient&rsquo; and
&lsquo;inconvenient&rsquo; is best explained by an example,&rdquo;
said the Other Professor, who had
overheard the question. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just think
over any Poem that contains the two words&mdash;such
as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor put his hands over his ears,
with a look of dismay. &ldquo;If you once let him
begin a <i>Poem</i>,&rdquo; he said to Sylvie, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll never
leave off again! He never does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave
off again?&rdquo; Sylvie enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>Bruno raised himself on tiptoe, till his lips
were on a level with Sylvie&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;What
became of them three Poems?&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Is he saying them all, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;The Other Professor
is speaking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it very quick,&rdquo; murmured the Other
Professor, with downcast eyes, and melancholy
voice, which contrasted oddly with his face,
as he had forgotten to leave off smiling. (&ldquo;At
least it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a <i>smile</i>,&rdquo; as Sylvie said
afterwards: &ldquo;it looked as if his mouth was
made that shape.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on then,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;<i>What
must be must be.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that!&rdquo; Sylvie whispered to
Bruno, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good rule for whenever
you hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a very good rule for whenever I
make a noise,&rdquo; said the saucy little fellow.
&ldquo;So <i>you</i> remember it too, Miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo; said Sylvie,
trying to frown, a thing she never managed
particularly well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oftens and oftens,&rdquo; said Bruno, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t
oo told me &lsquo;There mustn&rsquo;t be so much noise,
Bruno!&rsquo; when I&rsquo;ve tolded oo &lsquo;There <i>must</i>!&rsquo;
Why, there isn&rsquo;t no rules at all about &lsquo;There
mustn&rsquo;t&rsquo;! But oo never believes <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if any one <i>could</i> believe <i>you</i>, you wicked
wicked boy!&rdquo; said Sylvie. The <i>words</i> were
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
severe enough, but I am of opinion that, when
you are really <i>anxious</i> to impress a criminal
with a sense of his guilt, you ought not to pronounce
the sentence with your lips <i>quite</i> close
to his cheek&mdash;since a kiss at the end of it, however
accidental, weakens the effect terribly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">PETER AND PAUL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; the Other Professor resumed,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll just think over any Poem,
that contains the words&mdash;such as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Peter is poor,&rsquo; said noble Paul,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;And I have always been his friend:</p>

<p class="t0">How few, in this cold age of greed,</p>

<p class="t0">Give me a year to speculate&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">To buy and sell&mdash;to drive a trade&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Said Paul &lsquo;I cannot change the date.</p>
<p class="t">On May the Fourth it must be paid.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said Peter, with a sigh.</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Hand me the cash, and I will go.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll form a Joint-Stock Company,</p>
<p class="t">And turn an honest pound or so.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m grieved,&rsquo; said Paul, &lsquo;to seem unkind:</p>
<p class="t">The money shall of course be lent:</p>
<p class="t0">But, for a week or two, I find</p>
<p class="t">It will not be convenient.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So, week by week, poor Peter came</p>

</div>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see in a moment what the difference
is between &lsquo;convenient&rsquo; and &lsquo;inconvenient.&rsquo;
You quite understand it now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
added, looking kindly at Bruno, who was sitting,
at Sylvie&rsquo;s side, on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bruno, very quietly. Such a
short speech was very unusual, for him: but
just then he seemed, I fancied, a little exhausted.
In fact, he climbed up into Sylvie&rsquo;s
lap as he spoke, and rested his head against
her shoulder. &ldquo;What a many verses it was!&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A MUSICAL GARDENER.</span></h2>
<p>The Other Professor regarded him with some
anxiety. &ldquo;The smaller animal ought to go to
bed <i>at once</i>,&rdquo; he said with an air of authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>at once</i>?&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he can&rsquo;t go at twice,&rdquo; said the
Other Professor.</p>
<p>The Professor gently clapped his hands.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he <i>wonderful</i>!&rdquo; he said to Sylvie.
&ldquo;Nobody else could have thought of the
reason, so quick. Why, <i>of course</i> he ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
go at twice! It would hurt him to be
divided.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>This remark woke up Bruno, suddenly and
completely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be <i>divided</i>,&rdquo; he
said decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does very well on a <i>diagram</i>,&rdquo; said the
Other Professor. &ldquo;I could show it you in a
minute, only the chalk&rsquo;s a little blunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; Sylvie anxiously exclaimed,
as he began, rather clumsily, to point it.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll cut your finger off, if you hold the
knife so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If oo cuts it off, will oo give it to <i>me</i>,
please?&rdquo; Bruno thoughtfully added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said the Other Professor,
hastily drawing a long line upon the black
board, and marking the letters &lsquo;<i>A</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>B</i>,&rsquo; at
the two ends, and &lsquo;<i>C</i>&rsquo; in the middle: &ldquo;let
me explain it to you. If <i>AB</i> were to be
divided into two parts at <i>C</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be drownded,&rdquo; Bruno pronounced
confidently.</p>
<p>The Other Professor gasped. &ldquo;<i>What</i> would
be drownded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the bumble-bee, of course!&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;And the two bits would sink down
in the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Here the Professor interfered, as the Other
Professor was evidently too much puzzled to
go on with his diagram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I said it would <i>hurt</i> him, I was merely
referring to the action of the nerves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Other Professor brightened up in a
moment. &ldquo;The action of the nerves,&rdquo; he
began eagerly, &ldquo;is curiously slow in some
people. I had a friend, once, that, if you
burnt him with a red-hot poker, it would take
years and years before he felt it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you only <i>pinched</i> him?&rdquo; queried
Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would take ever so much longer,
of course. In fact, I doubt if the man <i>himself</i>
would ever feel it, at all. His grandchildren
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be the grandchild of a
pinched grandfather, would <i>you</i>, Mister Sir?&rdquo;
Bruno whispered. &ldquo;It might come just when
you wanted to be happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would be awkward, I admitted, taking
it quite as a matter of course that he had so
suddenly caught sight of me. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you
<i>always</i> want to be happy, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>always</i>,&rdquo; Bruno said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Sometimes, when I&rsquo;s <i>too</i> happy, I wants to
be a little miserable. Then I just tell Sylvie
about it, oo know, and Sylvie sets me some
lessons. Then it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t like lessons,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;You should copy Sylvie. <i>She&rsquo;s</i> always as
busy as the day is long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so am <i>I</i>!&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Sylvie corrected him. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i>
as busy as the day is <i>short</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; Bruno asked.
&ldquo;Mister Sir, isn&rsquo;t the day as short as it&rsquo;s
long? I mean, isn&rsquo;t it the <i>same</i> length?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never having considered the question in this
light, I suggested that they had better ask the
Professor; and they ran off in a moment to
appeal to their old friend. The Professor left
off polishing his spectacles to consider. &ldquo;My
dears,&rdquo; he said after a minute, &ldquo;the day is
the same length as anything that is the same
length as <i>it</i>.&rdquo; And he resumed his neverending
task of polishing.</p>
<p>The children returned, slowly and thoughtfully,
to report his answer. &ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> he wise?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
Sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper. &ldquo;If <i>I</i>
was as wise as <i>that</i>, I should have a head-ache
all day long. I <i>know</i> I should!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear to be talking to somebody&mdash;that
isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; the Professor said, turning
round to the children. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked puzzled. &ldquo;I never talks to
nobody when he isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t good manners. Oo should always wait
till he comes, before oo talks to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor looked anxiously in my direction,
and seemed to look through and through
me without seeing me. &ldquo;Then who are you
talking to?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anybody
here, you know, except the Other Professor&mdash;and
<i>he</i> isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; he added wildly,
turning round and round like a teetotum.
&ldquo;Children! Help to look for him! Quick!
He&rsquo;s got lost again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were on their feet in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we look?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo; shouted the excited Professor.
&ldquo;Only be quick about it!&rdquo; And he began
trotting round and round the room, lifting up
the chairs, and shaking them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Bruno took a very small book out of the
bookcase, opened it, and shook it in imitation
of the Professor. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t <i>here</i>,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> be there, Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie said
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course he ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;I should
have shooked him out, if he&rsquo;d been in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he ever been lost before?&rdquo; Sylvie
enquired, turning up a corner of the hearth-rug,
and peeping under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once before,&rdquo; said the Professor: &ldquo;he once
lost himself in a wood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And couldn&rsquo;t he find his-self again?&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he shout? He&rsquo;d be
sure to hear his-self, &rsquo;cause he couldn&rsquo;t be far
off, oo know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try shouting,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we shout?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On second thoughts, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> shout,&rdquo; the
Professor replied. &ldquo;The Vice-Warden might
hear you. He&rsquo;s getting awfully strict!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reminded the poor children of all the
troubles, about which they had come to their
old friend. Bruno sat down on the floor
and began crying. &ldquo;He <i>is</i> so cruel!&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
sobbed. &ldquo;And he lets Uggug take away <i>all</i>
my toys! And such horrid meals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you have for dinner to-day?&rdquo; said
the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little piece of a dead crow,&rdquo; was Bruno&rsquo;s
mournful reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means rook-pie,&rdquo; Sylvie explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>were</i> a dead crow,&rdquo; Bruno persisted.
&ldquo;And there were a apple-pudding&mdash;and Uggug
ate it all&mdash;and I got nuffin but a crust!
And I asked for a orange&mdash;and&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
get it!&rdquo; And the poor little fellow buried his
face in Sylvie&rsquo;s lap, who kept gently stroking
his hair, as she went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true,
Professor dear! They <i>do</i> treat my darling
Bruno very badly! And they&rsquo;re not kind to
<i>me</i> either,&rdquo; she added in a lower tone, as if
<i>that</i> were a thing of much less importance.</p>
<p>The Professor got out a large red silk handkerchief,
and wiped his eyes. &ldquo;I wish I could
help you, dear children!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what
<i>can</i> I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the way to Fairyland&mdash;where
Father&rsquo;s gone&mdash;quite well,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;if
only the Gardener would let us out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he open the door for you?&rdquo; said
the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for <i>us</i>,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure he
would for <i>you</i>. Do come and ask him, Professor
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come this minute!&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>Bruno sat up and dried his eyes. &ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i>
he kind, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is <i>indeed</i>,&rdquo; said I. But the Professor
took no notice of my remark. He had put on
a beautiful cap with a long tassel, and was
selecting one of the Other Professor&rsquo;s walking-sticks,
from a stand in the corner of the room.
&ldquo;A thick stick in one&rsquo;s hand makes people respectful,&rdquo;
he was saying to himself. &ldquo;Come
along, dear children!&rdquo; And we all went out
into the garden together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall address him, first of all,&rdquo; the
Professor explained as we went along, &ldquo;with a
few playful remarks on the weather. I shall
then question him about the Other Professor.
This will have a double advantage. First, it
will open the conversation (you can&rsquo;t even
drink a bottle of wine without opening it first):
and secondly, if he&rsquo;s seen the Other Professor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
we shall find him that way: and, if he hasn&rsquo;t,
we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On our way, we passed the target, at which
Uggug had been made to shoot during the
Ambassador&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the Professor, pointing out a
hole in the middle of the bull&rsquo;s-eye. &ldquo;His
Imperial Fatness had only <i>one</i> shot at it; and
he went in just <i>here</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno carefully examined the hole. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
go in <i>there</i>,&rdquo; he whispered to me. &ldquo;He are
too <i>fat</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had no sort of difficulty in <i>finding</i> the
Gardener. Though he was hidden from us by
some trees, that harsh voice of his served to
direct us; and, as we drew nearer, the words
of his song became more and more plainly
audible:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw an Albatross</p>
<p class="t">That fluttered round the lamp:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Penny-Postage-Stamp.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;You&rsquo;d best be getting home,&rsquo; he said:</p>

<p class="center small">&lsquo;HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ALBATROSS&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be afraid of catching cold?&rdquo; said
Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it got <i>very</i> damp,&rdquo; Sylvie suggested, &ldquo;it
might stick to something, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>that</i> somefin would have to go by
the post, whatever it was!&rdquo; Bruno eagerly exclaimed.
&ldquo;Suppose it was a cow! Wouldn&rsquo;t
it be <i>dreadful</i> for the other things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all these things happened to <i>him</i>,&rdquo;
said the Professor. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes the
song so interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have had a very curious life,&rdquo;
said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say that!&rdquo; the Professor heartily
rejoined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she may!&rdquo; cried Bruno.</p>
<p>By this time we had come up to the
Gardener, who was standing on one leg, as
usual, and busily employed in watering a bed
of flowers with an empty watering-can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t got no water in it!&rdquo; Bruno
explained to him, pulling his sleeve to attract
his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lighter to hold,&rdquo; said the Gardener. &ldquo;A
lot of water in it makes one&rsquo;s arms ache.&rdquo;
And he went on with his work, singing softly
to himself</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The nights are very damp!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;In digging things out of the ground&mdash;which
you probably do now and then,&rdquo; the
Professor began in a loud voice; &ldquo;in making
things into heaps&mdash;which no doubt you often
do; and in kicking things about with one
heel&mdash;which you seem never to leave off doing;
have you ever happened to notice another Professor,
something like me, but different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; shouted the Gardener, so loudly
and violently that we all drew back in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will try a less exciting topic,&rdquo; the
Professor mildly remarked to the children.
&ldquo;You were asking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We asked him to let us through the garden-door,&rdquo;
said Sylvie: &ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t: but
perhaps he would for <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor put the request, very humbly
and courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind letting <i>you</i> out,&rdquo; said the
Gardener. &ldquo;But I mustn&rsquo;t open the door for
<i>children</i>. D&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;d disobey the <i>Rules</i>?
Not for one-and-sixpence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor cautiously produced a couple
of shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; the Gardener shouted, as
he hurled the watering-can across the flower-bed,
and produced a handful of keys&mdash;one
large one, and a number of small ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, Professor dear!&rdquo; whispered
Sylvie. &ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t open the door for <i>us</i>,
at all. We can go out with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, dear child!&rdquo; the Professor thankfully
replied, as he replaced the coins in his pocket.
&ldquo;That saves two shillings!&rdquo; And he took the
children&rsquo;s hands, that they might all go out
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
together when the door was opened. This,
however, did not seem a very likely event,
though the Gardener patiently tried all the
small keys, over and over again.</p>
<p>At last the Professor ventured on a gentle
suggestion. &ldquo;Why not try the <i>large</i> one? I
have often observed that a door unlocks <i>much</i>
more nicely with its <i>own</i> key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very first trial of the large key proved
a success: the Gardener opened the door, and
held out his hand for the money.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head. &ldquo;You are
acting by <i>Rule</i>,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;in opening
the door for <i>me</i>. And now it&rsquo;s open, we are
going out by <i>Rule</i>&mdash;the Rule of <i>Three</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gardener looked puzzled, and let us go
out; but, as he locked the door behind us, we
heard him singing thoughtfully to himself</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He thought he saw a Garden-Door</p>
<p class="t">That opened with a key:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Double Rule of Three:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;And all its mystery,&rsquo; he said,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Is clear as day to me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall now return,&rdquo; said the Professor,
when we had walked a few yards: &ldquo;you see,
it&rsquo;s impossible to read <i>here</i>, for all my books
are in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the children still kept fast hold of his
hands. &ldquo;<i>Do</i> come with us!&rdquo; Sylvie entreated
with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the good-natured old
man. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll come after you, some day
soon. But I <i>must</i> go back <i>now</i>. You see I
left off at a comma, and it&rsquo;s so awkward not
knowing how the sentence finishes! Besides,
you&rsquo;ve got to go through Dogland first, and
I&rsquo;m always a little nervous about dogs. But
it&rsquo;ll be quite easy to come, as soon as I&rsquo;ve
completed my new invention&mdash;for carrying
one&rsquo;s-<i>self</i>, you know. It wants just a <i>little</i>
more working-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be very tiring, to carry <i>yourself</i>?&rdquo;
Sylvie enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, my child. You see, whatever
fatigue one incurs by <i>carrying</i>, one saves by
<i>being carried</i>! Good-bye, dears! Good-bye,
Sir!&rdquo; he added to my intense surprise, giving
my hand an affectionate squeeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Professor!&rdquo; I replied: but my
voice sounded strange and far away, and the
children took not the slightest notice of our
farewell. Evidently they neither saw me nor
heard me, as, with their arms lovingly twined
round each other, they marched boldly on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">A VISIT TO DOGLAND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a house, away there to the left,&rdquo;
said Sylvie, after we had walked what seemed
to me about fifty miles. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and ask for
a night&rsquo;s lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks a very comfable house,&rdquo; Bruno
said, as we turned into the road leading up to
it. &ldquo;I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us,
I <i>is</i> so tired and hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Mastiff, dressed in a scarlet collar, and
carrying a musket, was pacing up and down,
like a sentinel, in front of the entrance. He
started, on catching sight of the children, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
came forwards to meet them, keeping his
musket pointed straight at Bruno, who stood
quite still, though he turned pale and kept tight
hold of Sylvie&rsquo;s hand, while the Sentinel walked
solemnly round and round them, and looked at
them from all points of view.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/i172.jpg" alt="THE MASTIFF-SENTINEL" width="500" height="388" />
<p class="center small">THE MASTIFF-SENTINEL</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oobooh, hooh boohooyah!&rdquo; He growled
at last. &ldquo;Woobah yahwah oobooh! Bow
wahbah woobooyah? Bow wow?&rdquo; he asked
Bruno, severely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Of course <i>Bruno</i> understood all this, easily
enough. All Fairies understand Doggee&mdash;that
is, Dog-language. But, as <i>you</i> may find it
a little difficult, just at first, I had better put it
into English for you. &ldquo;Humans, I verily believe!
A couple of stray Humans! What Dog
do you belong to? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t belong to a <i>Dog</i>!&rdquo; Bruno began,
in Doggee. (&ldquo;Peoples <i>never</i> belongs to Dogs!&rdquo;
he whispered to Sylvie.)</p>
<p>But Sylvie hastily checked him, for fear of
hurting the Mastiff&rsquo;s feelings. &ldquo;Please, we
want a little food, and a night&rsquo;s lodging&mdash;if
there&rsquo;s room in the house,&rdquo; she added timidly.
Sylvie spoke Doggee very prettily: but I think
it&rsquo;s almost better, for <i>you</i>, to give the conversation
in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>house</i>, indeed!&rdquo; growled the Sentinel.
&ldquo;Have you never seen a <i>Palace</i> in your life?
Come along with me! His Majesty must settle
what&rsquo;s to be done with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him through the entrance-hall,
down a long passage, and into a magnificent
Saloon, around which were grouped dogs of all
sorts and sizes. Two splendid Blood-hounds
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
were solemnly sitting up, one on each side of
the crown-bearer. Two or three Bull-dogs&mdash;whom
I guessed to be the Body-Guard of the
King&mdash;were waiting in grim silence: in fact
the only voices at all plainly audible were
those of two little dogs, who had mounted a
settee, and were holding a lively discussion
that looked very like a quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lords and Ladies in Waiting, and various
Court Officials,&rdquo; our guide gruffly remarked,
as he led us in. Of <i>me</i> the Courtiers took no
notice whatever: but Sylvie and Bruno were
the subject of many inquisitive looks, and many
whispered remarks, of which I only distinctly
caught <i>one</i>&mdash;made by a sly-looking Dachshund
to his friend&mdash;&ldquo;Bah wooh wahyah hoobah
Oobooh, <i>hah</i> bah?&rdquo; (&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not such a bad-looking
Human, <i>is</i> she?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Leaving the new arrivals in the centre of
the Saloon, the Sentinel advanced to a door,
at the further end of it, which bore an inscription,
painted on it in Doggee, &ldquo;Royal
Kennel&mdash;Scratch and Yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before doing this, the Sentinel turned to the
children, and said &ldquo;Give me your names.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather not!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed, pulling
Sylvie away from the door. &ldquo;We want them
ourselves. Come back, Sylvie! Come quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Sylvie very decidedly:
and gave their names in Doggee.</p>
<p>Then the Sentinel scratched violently at the
door, and gave a yell that made Bruno shiver
from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooyah wah!&rdquo; said a deep voice inside.
(That&rsquo;s Doggee for &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the King himself!&rdquo; the Mastiff whispered
in an awestruck tone. &ldquo;Take off your wigs,
and lay them humbly at his paws.&rdquo; (What <i>we</i>
should call &ldquo;at his <i>feet</i>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Sylvie was just going to explain, very
politely, that really they <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> perform <i>that</i>
ceremony, because their wigs wouldn&rsquo;t come
off, when the door of the Royal Kennel opened,
and an enormous Newfoundland Dog put his
head out. &ldquo;Bow wow?&rdquo; was his first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When His Majesty speaks to you,&rdquo; the
Sentinel hastily whispered to Bruno, &ldquo;you
should prick up your ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather not, please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/i176.jpg" alt="THE DOG-KING" width="500" height="323" />
<p class="center small">THE DOG-KING</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt a bit!&rdquo; the Sentinel said
with some indignation. &ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s like this!&rdquo;
And he pricked up his ears like two railway
signals.</p>
<p>Sylvie gently explained matters. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
we ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t manage it,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry: but our ears haven&rsquo;t got the
right&mdash;&rdquo; she wanted to say &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; in
Doggee: but she had forgotten the word, and
could only think of &ldquo;steam-engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sentinel repeated Sylvie&rsquo;s explanation
to the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t prick up their ears without a steam-engine!&rdquo;
His Majesty exclaimed. &ldquo;They <i>must</i>
be curious creatures! I must have a look at
them!&rdquo; And he came out of his Kennel, and
walked solemnly up to the children.</p>
<p>What was the amazement&mdash;not to say the
horror&mdash;of the whole assembly, when Sylvie
actually <i>patted His Majesty on the head</i>, while
Bruno seized his long ears and pretended to tie
them together under his chin!</p>
<p>The Sentinel groaned aloud: a beautiful
Greyhound&mdash;who appeared to be one of the
Ladies in Waiting&mdash;fainted away: and all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
other Courtiers hastily drew back, and left
plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to
spring upon the audacious strangers, and tear
them limb from limb.</p>
<p>Only&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t. On the contrary his
Majesty actually <i>smiled</i>&mdash;so far as a Dog <i>can</i>
smile&mdash;and (the other Dogs couldn&rsquo;t believe
their eyes, but it was true, all the same) his
Majesty <i>wagged his tail</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah! Hooh hahwooh!&rdquo; (that is &ldquo;Well!
I never!&rdquo;) was the universal cry.</p>
<p>His Majesty looked round him severely, and
gave a slight growl, which produced instant
silence. &ldquo;Conduct <i>my friends</i> to the banqueting-hall!&rdquo;
he said, laying such an emphasis on
&ldquo;<i>my friends</i>&rdquo; that several of the dogs rolled
over helplessly on their backs and began to
lick Bruno&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>A procession was formed, but I only ventured
to follow as far as the <i>door</i> of the banqueting-hall,
so furious was the uproar of barking
dogs within. So I sat down by the King,
who seemed to have gone to sleep, and waited
till the children returned to say good-night,
when His Majesty got up and shook himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time for bed!&rdquo; he said with a sleepy
yawn. &ldquo;The attendants will show you your
room,&rdquo; he added, aside, to Sylvie and Bruno.
&ldquo;Bring lights!&rdquo; And, with a dignified air, he
held out his paw for them to kiss.</p>
<p>But the children were evidently not well
practised in Court-manners. Sylvie simply
stroked the great paw: Bruno hugged it: the
Master of the Ceremonies looked shocked.</p>
<p>All this time Dog-waiters, in splendid livery,
were running up with lighted candles: but, as
fast as they put them upon the table, other
waiters ran away with them, so that there
never seemed to be one for <i>me</i>, though the
Master kept nudging me with his elbow, and
repeating &ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let you sleep <i>here</i>! You&rsquo;re
not in <i>bed</i>, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made a great effort, and just succeeded
in getting out the words &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not.
I&rsquo;m in an arm-chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, forty winks will do you no harm,&rdquo; the
Master said, and left me. I could scarcely hear
his words: and no wonder: he was leaning
over the side of a ship, that was miles away
from the pier on which I stood. The ship
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
passed over the horizon, and I sank back into
the arm-chair.</p>
<p>The next thing I remember is that it was
morning: breakfast was just over: Sylvie was
lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying
to a Spaniel, who was regarding them with
a most benevolent smile, &ldquo;Yes, thank you, we&rsquo;ve
had a <i>very</i> nice breakfast. Haven&rsquo;t we, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was too many bones in the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Bruno began, but Sylvie frowned at him, and
laid her finger on her lips, for, at this moment,
the travelers were waited on by a very dignified
officer, the Head-Growler, whose duty it
was, first to conduct them to the King to bid
him farewell, and then to escort them to the
boundary of Dogland. The great Newfoundland
received them most affably, but, instead
of saying &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; he startled the Head-Growler
into giving three savage growls, by
announcing that he would escort them himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most unusual proceeding, your
Majesty!&rdquo; the Head-Growler exclaimed, almost
choking with vexation at being set aside, for he
had put on his best Court-suit, made entirely of
cat-skins, for the occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall escort them myself,&rdquo; his Majesty
repeated, gently but firmly, laying aside the
Royal robes, and changing his crown for a
small coronet, &ldquo;and you may stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>are</i> glad!&rdquo; Bruno whispered to Sylvie,
when they had got well out of hearing. &ldquo;He
were so <i>welly</i> cross!&rdquo; And he not only patted
their Royal escort, but even hugged him round
the neck in the exuberance of his delight.</p>
<p>His Majesty calmly wagged the Royal tail.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a relief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;getting away
from that Palace now and then! Royal Dogs
have a dull life of it, I can tell you! Would
you mind&rdquo; (this to Sylvie, in a low voice, and
looking a little shy and embarrassed) &ldquo;would
you mind the trouble of just throwing that
stick for me to fetch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie was too much astonished to do anything
for a moment: it sounded such a monstrous
impossibility that a <i>King</i> should wish to
run after a stick. But <i>Bruno</i> was equal to the
occasion, and with a glad shout of &ldquo;Hi then!
Fetch it, good Doggie!&rdquo; he hurled it over a
clump of bushes. The next moment the
Monarch of Dogland had bounded over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
bushes, and picked up the stick, and came
galloping back to the children with it in his
mouth. Bruno took it from him with great
decision. &ldquo;Beg for it!&rdquo; he insisted; and His
Majesty begged. &ldquo;Paw!&rdquo; commanded Sylvie;
and His Majesty gave his paw. In short, the
solemn ceremony of escorting the travelers to
the boundaries of Dogland became one long
uproarious game of play!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But business is business!&rdquo; the Dog-King
said at last. &ldquo;And I must go back to mine.
I couldn&rsquo;t come any further,&rdquo; he added, consulting
a dog-watch, which hung on a chain
round his neck, &ldquo;not even if there were a <i>Cat</i>
in sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took an affectionate farewell of His
Majesty, and trudged on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>were</i> a dear dog!&rdquo; Bruno exclaimed.
&ldquo;Has we to go far, Sylvie? I&rsquo;s tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much further, darling!&rdquo; Sylvie gently
replied. &ldquo;Do you see that shining, just beyond
those trees? I&rsquo;m almost <i>sure</i> it&rsquo;s the gate of
Fairyland! I know it&rsquo;s all golden&mdash;Father
told me so&mdash;and so bright, so bright!&rdquo; she
went on dreamily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;It dazzles!&rdquo; said Bruno, shading his eyes
with one little hand, while the other clung
tightly to Sylvie&rsquo;s hand, as if he were half-alarmed
at her strange manner.</p>
<p>For the child moved on as if walking in her
sleep, her large eyes gazing into the far distance,
and her breath coming and going in
quick pantings of eager delight. I knew, by
some mysterious mental light, that a great
change was taking place in my sweet little
friend (for such I loved to think her) and that
she was passing from the condition of a mere
Outland Sprite into the true Fairy-nature.</p>
<p>Upon Bruno the change came later: but it
was completed in both before they reached the
golden gate, through which I knew it would
be impossible for <i>me</i> to follow. I could but
stand outside, and take a last look at the two
sweet children, ere they disappeared within,
and the golden gate closed with a bang.</p>
<p>And with <i>such</i> a bang! &ldquo;It never <i>will</i>
shut like any other cupboard-door,&rdquo; Arthur
explained. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with
the hinge. However, here&rsquo;s the cake and wine.
And you&rsquo;ve had your forty winks. So you
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
really <i>must</i> get off to bed, old man! You&rsquo;re
fit for nothing else. Witness my hand, Arthur
Forester, M.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time I was wide-awake again. &ldquo;Not
<i>quite</i> yet!&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;Really I&rsquo;m not sleepy
now. And it isn&rsquo;t midnight yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did want to say another word to
you,&rdquo; Arthur replied in a relenting tone, as he
supplied me with the supper he had prescribed.
&ldquo;Only I thought you were too sleepy for it
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We took our midnight meal almost in silence;
for an unusual nervousness seemed to have
seized on my old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a night is it?&rdquo; he asked,
rising and undrawing the window-curtains, apparently
to change the subject for a minute.
I followed him to the window, and we stood
together, looking out, in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first spoke to you about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Arthur began, after a long and embarrassing
silence, &ldquo;that is, when we first talked about her&mdash;for
I think it was <i>you</i> that introduced the
subject&mdash;my own position in life forbade me
to do more than worship her from a distance:
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
and I was turning over plans for leaving this
place finally, and settling somewhere out of all
chance of meeting her again. That seemed
to be my only chance of usefulness in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that have been wise?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;To
leave yourself no hope at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>was</i> no hope to leave,&rdquo; Arthur firmly
replied, though his eyes glittered with tears
as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky,
from which one solitary star, the glorious
&lsquo;Vega,&rsquo; blazed out in fitful splendour through
the driving clouds. &ldquo;She was like that star
to me&mdash;bright, beautiful, and pure, but out
of reach, out of reach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the curtains again, and we returned
to our places by the fireside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I wanted to tell you was this,&rdquo; he
resumed. &ldquo;I heard this evening from my
solicitor. I can&rsquo;t go into the details of the
business, but the upshot is that my worldly
wealth is much more than I thought, and I
am (or shall soon be) in a position to offer
marriage, without imprudence, to any lady, even
if she brought nothing. I doubt if there would
be anything on <i>her</i> side: the Earl is poor, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
believe. But I should have enough for both,
even if health failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you all happiness in your married
life!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Shall you speak to the Earl
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet awhile,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;He is very
friendly, but I dare not think he means more
than that, as yet. And as for&mdash;as for Lady
Muriel, try as I may, I <i>cannot</i> read her feelings
towards me. If there <i>is</i> love, she is hiding it!
No, I must wait, I must wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not like to press any further advice on
my friend, whose judgment, I felt, was so much
more sober and thoughtful than my own; and
we parted without more words on the subject
that had now absorbed his thoughts, nay, his
very life.</p>
<p>The next morning a letter from <i>my</i> solicitor
arrived, summoning me to town on important
business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">FAIRY-SYLVIE.</span></h2>
<p>For a full month the business, for which I
had returned to London, detained me there:
and even then it was only the urgent advice
of my physician that induced me to leave it
unfinished and pay another visit to Elveston.</p>
<p>Arthur had written once or twice during
the month; but in none of his letters was
there any mention of Lady Muriel. Still, I
did not augur ill from his silence: to me it
looked like the natural action of a lover, who,
even while his heart was singing &ldquo;She is
mine!&rdquo;, would fear to paint his happiness in
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
the cold phrases of a written letter, but would
wait to tell it by word of mouth. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I
thought, &ldquo;I am to hear his song of triumph
from his own lips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night I arrived we had much to say on
other matters: and, tired with the journey, I
went to bed early, leaving the happy secret
still untold. Next day, however, as we chatted
on over the remains of luncheon, I ventured
to put the momentous question. &ldquo;Well, old
friend, you have told me nothing of Lady
Muriel&mdash;nor when the happy day is to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The happy day,&rdquo; Arthur said, looking
unexpectedly grave, &ldquo;is yet in the dim future.
We need to know&mdash;or, rather, <i>she</i> needs to
know <i>me</i> better. I know <i>her</i> sweet nature,
thoroughly, by this time. But I dare not speak
till I am sure that my love is returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait too long!&rdquo; I said gaily. &ldquo;Faint
heart never won fair lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> &lsquo;faint heart,&rsquo; perhaps. But really I
<i>dare</i> not speak just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But meanwhile,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;you are running
a risk that perhaps you have not thought
of. Some other man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Arthur firmly. &ldquo;She is heart-whole:
I am sure of that. Yet, if she loves
another better than me, so be it! I will not
spoil her happiness. The secret shall die with
me. But she is my first&mdash;and my <i>only</i> love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all very beautiful <i>sentiment</i>,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but it is not <i>practical</i>. It is not like <i>you</i>.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He either fears his fate too much,</p>
<p class="t">Or his desert is small,</p>
<p class="t0">Who dares not put it to the touch,</p>
<p class="t">To win or lose it all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>dare</i> not ask the question whether there
is another!&rdquo; he said passionately. &ldquo;It would
break my heart to know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet is it wise to leave it unasked? You
must not waste your life upon an &lsquo;if&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I <i>dare</i> not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May <i>I</i> find it out for you?&rdquo; I asked, with
the freedom of an old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he replied with a pained look.
&ldquo;I entreat you to say nothing. Let it wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; I said: and judged it best
to say no more just then. &ldquo;But this evening,&rdquo;
I thought, &ldquo;I will call on the Earl. I may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
able to <i>see</i> how the land lies, without so much
as saying a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very hot afternoon&mdash;too hot to go
for a walk or do anything&mdash;or else it wouldn&rsquo;t
have happened, I believe.</p>
<p>In the first place, I want to know&mdash;dear
Child who reads this!&mdash;why Fairies should
always be teaching <i>us</i> to do our duty, and
lecturing <i>us</i> when we go wrong, and we should
never teach <i>them</i> anything? You can&rsquo;t mean
to say that Fairies are never greedy, or selfish,
or cross, or deceitful, because that would be
nonsense, you know. Well then, don&rsquo;t you
think they might be all the better for a little
lecturing and punishing now and then?</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t see why it shouldn&rsquo;t be tried,
and I&rsquo;m almost sure that, if you could only
catch a Fairy, and put it in the corner, and
give it nothing but bread and water for a day
or two, you&rsquo;d find it quite an improved character&mdash;it
would take down its conceit a
little, at all events.</p>
<p>The next question is, what is the best time
for seeing Fairies? I believe I can tell you
all about that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The first rule is, that it must be a <i>very</i> hot
day&mdash;that we may consider as settled: and
you must be just a <i>little</i> sleepy&mdash;but not too
sleepy to keep your eyes open, mind. Well,
and you ought to feel a little&mdash;what one may
call &ldquo;fairyish&rdquo;&mdash;the Scotch call it &ldquo;eerie,&rdquo;
and perhaps that&rsquo;s a prettier word; if you
don&rsquo;t know what it means, I&rsquo;m afraid I can
hardly explain it; you must wait till you meet
a Fairy, and then you&rsquo;ll know.</p>
<p>And the last rule is, that the crickets should
not be chirping. I can&rsquo;t stop to explain that:
you must take it on trust for the present.</p>
<p>So, if all these things happen together, you
have a good chance of seeing a Fairy&mdash;or at
least a much better chance than if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed, as I went lazily
along through an open place in the wood, was
a large Beetle lying struggling on its back, and
I went down upon one knee to help the poor
thing to its feet again. In some things, you
know, you can&rsquo;t be quite sure what an insect
would like: for instance, I never could quite
settle, supposing I were a moth, whether I
would rather be kept out of the candle, or be
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
allowed to fly straight in and get burnt&mdash;or
again, supposing I were a spider, I&rsquo;m not sure
if I should be <i>quite</i> pleased to have my web
torn down, and the fly let loose&mdash;but I feel
quite certain that, if I were a beetle and had
rolled over on my back, I should always be
glad to be helped up again.</p>
<p>So, as I was saying, I had gone down upon
one knee, and was just reaching out a little
stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a
sight that made me draw back hastily and
hold my breath, for fear of making any noise
and frightening the little creature away.</p>
<p>Not that she looked as if she would be
easily frightened: she seemed so good and
gentle that I&rsquo;m sure she would never expect
that any one could wish to hurt her. She
was only a few inches high, and was dressed
in green, so that you really would hardly have
noticed her among the long grass; and she
was so delicate and graceful that she quite
seemed to belong to the place, almost as if
she were one of the flowers. I may tell you,
besides, that she had no wings (I don&rsquo;t believe
in Fairies with wings), and that she had quantities
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
of long brown hair and large earnest
brown eyes, and then I shall have done all
I can to give you an idea of her.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/i193.jpg" alt="FAIRY-SYLVIE" width="500" height="357" />
<p class="center small">FAIRY-SYLVIE</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie (I found out her name afterwards)
had knelt down, just as I was doing, to help
the Beetle; but it needed more than a little
stick for <i>her</i> to get it on its legs again; it was
as much as she could do, with both arms, to
roll the heavy thing over; and all the while
she was talking to it, half scolding and half
comforting, as a nurse might do with a child
that had fallen down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, there! You needn&rsquo;t cry so much
about it. You&rsquo;re not killed yet&mdash;though if
you were, you couldn&rsquo;t cry, you know, and
so it&rsquo;s a general rule against crying, my dear!
And how did you come to tumble over?
But I can see well enough how it was&mdash;I
needn&rsquo;t ask you that&mdash;walking over sand-pits
with your chin in the air, as usual. Of course
if you go among sand-pits like that, you must
expect to tumble. You should look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beetle murmured something that sounded
like &ldquo;I <i>did</i> look,&rdquo; and Sylvie went on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know you didn&rsquo;t! You never do!
You always walk with your chin up&mdash;you&rsquo;re
so dreadfully conceited. Well, let&rsquo;s see how
many legs are broken this time. Why, none
of them, I declare! And what&rsquo;s the good
of having six legs, my dear, if you can only
kick them all about in the air when you
tumble? Legs are meant to walk with, you
know. Now don&rsquo;t begin putting out your
wings yet; I&rsquo;ve more to say. Go to the
frog that lives behind that buttercup&mdash;give
him my compliments&mdash;Sylvie&rsquo;s compliments&mdash;can
you say &lsquo;compliments&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The Beetle tried and, I suppose, succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. And tell him he&rsquo;s to give
you some of that salve I left with him yesterday.
And you&rsquo;d better get him to rub it in
for you. He&rsquo;s got rather cold hands, but you
mustn&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think the Beetle must have shuddered at
this idea, for Sylvie went on in a graver tone.
&ldquo;Now you needn&rsquo;t pretend to be so particular
as all that, as if you were too grand to be
rubbed by a frog. The fact is, you ought to
be very much obliged to him. Suppose you
could get nobody but a toad to do it, how
would you like <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, and then Sylvie
added &ldquo;Now you may go. Be a good beetle,
and don&rsquo;t keep your chin in the air.&rdquo; And then
began one of those performances of humming,
and whizzing, and restless banging about, such
as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on
flying, but hasn&rsquo;t quite made up its mind which
way to go. At last, in one of its awkward zig-zags,
it managed to fly right into my face, and,
by the time I had recovered from the shock,
the little Fairy was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>I looked about in all directions for the little
creature, but there was no trace of her&mdash;and
my &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling was quite gone off, and
the crickets were chirping again merrily&mdash;so
I knew she was really gone.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ve got time to tell you the rule
about the crickets. They always leave off chirping
when a Fairy goes by&mdash;because a Fairy&rsquo;s
a kind of queen over them, I suppose&mdash;at all
events it&rsquo;s a much grander thing than a cricket&mdash;so
whenever you&rsquo;re walking out, and the
crickets suddenly leave off chirping, you may
be sure that they see a Fairy.</p>
<p>I walked on sadly enough, you may be sure.
However, I comforted myself with thinking
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a very wonderful afternoon, so far.
I&rsquo;ll just go quietly on and look about me, and
I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I were to come across
another Fairy somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peering about in this way, I happened to
notice a plant with rounded leaves, and with
queer little holes cut in the middle of several
of them. &ldquo;Ah, the leafcutter bee!&rdquo; I carelessly
remarked&mdash;you know I am very learned in
Natural History (for instance, I can always tell
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
kittens from chickens at one glance)&mdash;and I
was passing on, when a sudden thought made
me stoop down and examine the leaves.</p>
<p>Then a little thrill of delight ran through me&mdash;for
I noticed that the holes were all arranged
so as to form letters; there were three leaves
side by side, with &ldquo;B,&rdquo; &ldquo;R,&rdquo; and &ldquo;U&rdquo; marked
on them, and after some search I found two
more, which contained an &ldquo;N&rdquo; and an &ldquo;O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, all in a moment, a flash of inner
light seemed to illumine a part of my life that
had all but faded into oblivion&mdash;the strange
visions I had experienced during my journey
to Elveston: and with a thrill of delight I
thought &ldquo;Those visions are destined to be
linked with my waking life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling had come
back again, and I suddenly observed that no
crickets were chirping; so I felt quite sure
that &ldquo;Bruno&rdquo; was somewhere very near.</p>
<p>And so indeed he was&mdash;so near that I had
very nearly walked over him without seeing
him; which would have been dreadful, always
supposing that Fairies <i>can</i> be walked over&mdash;my
own belief is that they are something of
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
the nature of Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisps: and there&rsquo;s
no walking over <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>Think of any pretty little boy you know,
with rosy cheeks, large dark eyes, and tangled
brown hair, and then fancy him made small
enough to go comfortably into a coffee-cup,
and you&rsquo;ll have a very fair idea of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, little one?&rdquo; I began,
in as soft a voice as I could manage. And,
by the way, why is it we always begin by
asking little children their names? Is it
because we fancy a name will help to make
them a little bigger? You never thought of
asking a real large man his name, now, did
you? But, however that may be, I felt it
quite necessary to know <i>his</i> name; so, as he
didn&rsquo;t answer my question, I asked it again
a little louder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, my little
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s oors?&rdquo; he said, without looking up.</p>
<p>I told him my name quite gently, for he was
much too small to be angry with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duke of Anything?&rdquo; he asked, just looking
at me for a moment, and then going on with
his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not Duke at all,&rdquo; I said, a little ashamed
of having to confess it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&rsquo;re big enough to be two Dukes,&rdquo; said
the little creature. &ldquo;I suppose oo&rsquo;re Sir Something,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, feeling more and more ashamed.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fairy seemed to think that in that case
I really wasn&rsquo;t worth the trouble of talking to,
for he quietly went on digging, and tearing the
flowers to pieces.</p>
<p>After a few minutes I tried again. &ldquo;<i>Please</i>
tell me what your name is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno,&rdquo; the little fellow answered, very
readily. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t oo say &lsquo;please&rsquo; before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something like what we used to be
taught in the nursery,&rdquo; I thought to myself,
looking back through the long years (about
a hundred of them, since you ask the question),
to the time when I was a little child.
And here an idea came into my head, and
I asked him &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you one of the Fairies
that teach children to be good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have to do that sometimes,&rdquo; said
Bruno, &ldquo;and a dreadful bother it is.&rdquo; As he
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
said this, he savagely tore a heartsease in two,
and trampled on the pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you doing there, Bruno?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoiling Sylvie&rsquo;s garden,&rdquo; was all the answer
Bruno would give at first. But, as he
went on tearing up the flowers, he muttered to
himself &ldquo;The nasty cross thing&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t let
me go and play this morning,&mdash;said I must
finish my lessons first&mdash;lessons, indeed! I&rsquo;ll
vex her finely, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruno, you shouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that&rsquo;s revenge? And revenge
is a wicked, cruel, dangerous thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;River-edge?&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;What a funny
word! I suppose oo call it cruel and dangerous
&rsquo;cause, if oo wented too far and tumbleded
in, oo&rsquo;d get drownded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not river-edge,&rdquo; I explained: &ldquo;re-venge&rdquo;
(saying the word very slowly). But I
couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that Bruno&rsquo;s explanation
did very well for either word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Bruno, opening his eyes very
wide, but without trying to repeat the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Try and pronounce it, Bruno!&rdquo; I
said, cheerfully. &ldquo;Re-venge, re-venge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>But Bruno only tossed his little head, and
said he couldn&rsquo;t; that his mouth wasn&rsquo;t the
right shape for words of that kind. And the
more I laughed, the more sulky the little
fellow got about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind, my little man!&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Shall I help you with that job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; Bruno said, quite pacified.
&ldquo;Only I wiss I could think of somefin to
vex her more than this. Oo don&rsquo;t know
how hard it is to make her angry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, Bruno, and I&rsquo;ll teach
you quite a splendid kind of revenge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somefin that&rsquo;ll vex her finely?&rdquo; he asked
with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that will vex her finely. First,
we&rsquo;ll get up all the weeds in her garden. See,
there are a good many at this end&mdash;quite
hiding the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>that</i> won&rsquo;t vex her!&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that,&rdquo; I said, without noticing the remark,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll water this highest bed&mdash;up here.
You see it&rsquo;s getting quite dry and dusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno looked at me inquisitively, but he said
nothing this time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then after that,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;the walks
want sweeping a bit; and I think you might
cut down that tall nettle&mdash;it&rsquo;s so close to the
garden that it&rsquo;s quite in the way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> oo talking about?&rdquo; Bruno impatiently
interrupted me. &ldquo;All that won&rsquo;t vex
her a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I said, innocently. &ldquo;Then, after
that, suppose we put in some of these coloured
pebbles&mdash;just to mark the divisions between the
different kinds of flowers, you know. That&rsquo;ll
have a very pretty effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno turned round and had another good
stare at me. At last there came an odd little
twinkle into his eyes, and he said, with quite a
new meaning in his voice, &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do nicely.
Let&rsquo;s put &rsquo;em in rows&mdash;all the red together,
and all the blue together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do capitally,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and then&mdash;what
kind of flowers does Sylvie like best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth
and consider a little before he could answer.
&ldquo;Violets,&rdquo; he said, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a beautiful bed of violets down by
the brook&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s fetch &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Bruno, giving a
little skip into the air. &ldquo;Here! Catch hold of
my hand, and I&rsquo;ll help oo along. The grass is
rather thick down that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at his having so
entirely forgotten what a big creature he was
talking to. &ldquo;No, not yet, Bruno,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;we
must consider what&rsquo;s the right thing to do first.
You see we&rsquo;ve got quite a business before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s consider,&rdquo; said Bruno, putting his
thumb into his mouth again, and sitting down
upon a dead mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you keep that mouse for?&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;You should either bury it, or else throw it
into the brook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s to measure with!&rdquo; cried Bruno.
&ldquo;How ever would oo do a garden without
one? We make each bed three mouses and a
half long, and two mouses wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped him, as he was dragging it off by
the tail to show me how it was used, for I was
half afraid the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling might go off
before we had finished the garden, and in that
case I should see no more of him or Sylvie.
&ldquo;I think the best way will be for <i>you</i> to weed
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
the beds, while <i>I</i> sort out these pebbles, ready
to mark the walks with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell
oo about the caterpillars while we work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, let&rsquo;s hear about the caterpillars,&rdquo; I said,
as I drew the pebbles together into a heap and
began dividing them into colours.</p>
<p>And Bruno went on in a low, rapid tone,
more as if he were talking to himself. &ldquo;Yesterday
I saw two little caterpillars, when I was
sitting by the brook, just where oo go into the
wood. They were quite green, and they had
yellow eyes, and they didn&rsquo;t see <i>me</i>. And one
of them had got a moth&rsquo;s wing to carry&mdash;a
great brown moth&rsquo;s wing, oo know, all dry,
with feathers. So he couldn&rsquo;t want it to eat,
I should think&mdash;perhaps he meant to make
a cloak for the winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I said, for Bruno had twisted up
the last word into a sort of question, and was
looking at me for an answer.</p>
<p>One word was quite enough for the little
fellow, and he went on merrily.  &ldquo;Well, and
so he didn&rsquo;t want the other caterpillar to see
the moth&rsquo;s wing, oo know&mdash;so what must he
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
do but try to carry it with all his left legs,
and he tried to walk on the other set. Of
course he toppled over after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what?&rdquo; I said, catching at the last
word, for, to tell the truth, I hadn&rsquo;t been
attending much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He toppled over,&rdquo; Bruno repeated, very
gravely, &ldquo;and if <i>oo</i> ever saw a caterpillar
topple over, oo&rsquo;d know it&rsquo;s a welly serious
thing, and not sit grinning like that&mdash;and I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell oo no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and indeed, Bruno, I didn&rsquo;t mean
to grin. See, I&rsquo;m quite grave again now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bruno only folded his arms, and said
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>. I see a little twinkle in one
of oor eyes&mdash;just like the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think I&rsquo;m like the moon,
Bruno?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oor face is large and round like the moon,&rdquo;
Bruno answered, looking at me thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It doosn&rsquo;t shine quite so bright&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
more cleaner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help smiling at this. &ldquo;You know
I sometimes wash <i>my</i> face, Bruno. The moon
never does that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, doosn&rsquo;t she though!&rdquo; cried Bruno; and
he leant forwards and added in a solemn
whisper, &ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s face gets dirtier and
dirtier every night, till it&rsquo;s black all across.
And then, when it&rsquo;s dirty all over&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;&rdquo; (he
passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks
as he spoke) &ldquo;then she washes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all clean again, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all in a moment,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;What
a deal of teaching oo wants! She washes it
little by little&mdash;only she begins at the other
edge, oo know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time he was sitting quietly on the
dead mouse with his arms folded, and the
weeding wasn&rsquo;t getting on a bit: so I had
to say &ldquo;Work first, pleasure afterwards: no
more talking till that bed&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">BRUNO&rsquo;S REVENGE.</span></h2>
<p>After that we had a few minutes of silence,
while I sorted out the pebbles, and amused
myself with watching Bruno&rsquo;s plan of gardening.
It was quite a new plan to me: he
always measured each bed before he weeded
it, as if he was afraid the weeding would
make it shrink; and once, when it came out
longer than he wished, he set to work to
thump the mouse with his little fist, crying
out &ldquo;There now! It&rsquo;s all gone wrong again!
Why don&rsquo;t oo keep oor tail straight when I
tell oo!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Bruno said in a
half-whisper, as we worked. &ldquo;Oo like Fairies,
don&rsquo;t oo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;of course I do, or I shouldn&rsquo;t
have come here. I should have gone to some
place where there are no Fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;Why, oo
might as well say oo&rsquo;d go to some place where
there wasn&rsquo;t any air&mdash;supposing oo didn&rsquo;t
like air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a rather difficult idea to grasp. I
tried a change of subject. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly the
first Fairy I ever saw. Have <i>you</i> ever seen
any people besides me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;We see &rsquo;em when
we walk in the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see <i>you</i>. How is it they
never tread on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>tread</i> on us,&rdquo; said Bruno, looking
amused at my ignorance. &ldquo;Why, suppose
oo&rsquo;re walking, here&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo; (making little
marks on the ground) &ldquo;and suppose there&rsquo;s a
Fairy&mdash;that&rsquo;s me&mdash;walking <i>here</i>. Very well
then, oo put one foot here, and one foot here,
so oo doosn&rsquo;t tread on the Fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>This was all very well as an explanation,
but it didn&rsquo;t convince me. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
I put one foot <i>on</i> the Fairy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know <i>why</i>,&rdquo; the little fellow said in
a thoughtful tone. &ldquo;But I know oo <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i>.
Nobody never walked on the top of a Fairy.
Now I&rsquo;ll tell oo what I&rsquo;ll do, as oo&rsquo;re so fond
of Fairies. I&rsquo;ll get oo an invitation to the
Fairy-King&rsquo;s dinner-party. I know one of the
head-waiters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at this idea. &ldquo;Do
the waiters invite the guests?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not <i>to sit down</i>!&rdquo; Bruno said. &ldquo;But
to wait at table. Oo&rsquo;d like that, wouldn&rsquo;t oo?
To hand about plates, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but that&rsquo;s not so nice as sitting at
the table, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bruno said, in a tone
as if he rather pitied my ignorance; &ldquo;but if
oo&rsquo;re not even Sir Anything, oo ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t expect
to be allowed to sit at the table, oo know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, as meekly as I could, that I didn&rsquo;t expect
it, but it was the only way of going to a
dinner-party that I really enjoyed. And Bruno
tossed his head, and said, in a rather offended
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
tone, that I might do as I pleased&mdash;there were
many he knew that would give their ears to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been yourself, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They invited me once, last week,&rdquo; Bruno
said, very gravely. &ldquo;It was to wash up the
soup-plates&mdash;no, the cheese-plates I mean&mdash;that
was grand enough. And I waited at table.
And I didn&rsquo;t hardly make only <i>one</i> mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind
telling <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only bringing scissors to cut the beef with,&rdquo;
Bruno said carelessly. &ldquo;But the grandest thing
of all was, <i>I</i> fetched the King a glass of cider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>was</i> grand!&rdquo; I said, biting my lip to
keep myself from laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Bruno, very earnestly.
&ldquo;Oo know it isn&rsquo;t every one that&rsquo;s had such
an honour as <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This set me thinking of the various queer
things we call &ldquo;an honour&rdquo; in this world, but
which, after all, haven&rsquo;t a bit more honour in
them than what Bruno enjoyed, when he took
the King a glass of cider.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long I might not have
dreamed on in this way, if Bruno hadn&rsquo;t suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
roused me. &ldquo;Oh, come here quick!&rdquo;
he cried, in a state of the wildest excitement.
&ldquo;Catch hold of his other horn! I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hold
him more than a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was struggling desperately with a great
snail, clinging to one of its horns, and nearly
breaking his poor little back in his efforts to
drag it over a blade of grass.</p>
<p>I saw we should have no more gardening if
I let this sort of thing go on, so I quietly took
the snail away, and put it on a bank where he
couldn&rsquo;t reach it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hunt it afterwards,
Bruno,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you really want to catch it.
But what&rsquo;s the use of it when you&rsquo;ve got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of a fox when oo&rsquo;ve got
it?&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;I know oo big things hunt
foxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to think of some good reason why
&ldquo;big things&rdquo; should hunt foxes, and he should
not hunt snails, but none came into my head:
so I said at last, &ldquo;Well, I suppose one&rsquo;s as
good as the other. I&rsquo;ll go snail-hunting myself
some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think oo wouldn&rsquo;t be so silly,&rdquo;
said Bruno, &ldquo;as to go snail-hunting by oorself.
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
Why, oo&rsquo;d never get the snail along, if
oo hadn&rsquo;t somebody to hold on to his other
horn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go <i>alone</i>,&rdquo; I said, quite
gravely. &ldquo;By the way, is that the best kind to
hunt, or do you recommend the ones without
shells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we never hunt the ones without
shells,&rdquo; Bruno said, with a little shudder at the
thought of it. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always so cross about
it; and then, if oo tumbles over them, they&rsquo;re
ever so sticky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we had nearly finished the garden.
I had fetched some violets, and Bruno
was just helping me to put in the last, when he
suddenly stopped and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest then,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I can go on without
you, quite well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno needed no second invitation: he at
once began arranging the dead mouse as a kind
of sofa. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll sing oo a little song,&rdquo; he
said, as he rolled it about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;I like songs very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which song will oo choose?&rdquo; Bruno said,
as he dragged the mouse into a place where he
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
could get a good view of me. &ldquo;&lsquo;Ting, ting,
ting&rsquo; is the nicest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no resisting such a strong hint as
this: however, I pretended to think about it for
a moment, and then said &ldquo;Well, I like &lsquo;Ting,
ting, ting,&rsquo; best of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center small">BRUNO&rsquo;S REVENGE</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That shows oo&rsquo;re a good judge of music,&rdquo;
Bruno said, with a pleased look. &ldquo;How many
hare-bells would oo like?&rdquo; And he put his
thumb into his mouth to help me to consider.</p>
<p>As there was only one cluster of hare-bells
within easy reach, I said very gravely that I
thought one would do <i>this</i> time, and I picked
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
it and gave it to him. Bruno ran his hand
once or twice up and down the flowers, like
a musician trying an instrument, producing a
most delicious delicate tinkling as he did so.
I had never heard flower-music before&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think one can, unless one&rsquo;s in the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo;
state&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know quite how to give
you an idea of what it was like, except by
saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a
thousand miles off. When he had satisfied
himself that the flowers were in tune, he
seated himself on the dead mouse (he never
seemed really comfortable anywhere else), and,
looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his
eyes, he began. By the way, the tune was
rather a curious one, and you might like to
try it for yourself, so here are the notes.</p>

<p class="t0">Welcoming our Fairy King,</p>
<p class="t">We sing, sing, sing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He sang the first four lines briskly and
merrily, making the hare-bells chime in time
with the music; but the last two he sang
quite slowly and gently, and merely waved
the flowers backwards and forwards. Then
he left off to explain. &ldquo;The Fairy-King is
Oberon, and he lives across the lake&mdash;and
sometimes he comes in a little boat&mdash;and we
go and meet him&mdash;and then we sing this
song, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you go and dine with him?&rdquo; I
said, mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo shouldn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Bruno hastily said: &ldquo;it
interrupts the song so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I wouldn&rsquo;t do it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never talk myself when I&rsquo;m singing,&rdquo;
he went on very gravely: &ldquo;so <i>oo</i> shouldn&rsquo;t

more, and sang:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Bruno!&rdquo; I interrupted in a warning
whisper. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno checked his song, and, as she slowly
made her way through the long grass, he
suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a
little bull, shouting &ldquo;Look the other way!
Look the other way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; Sylvie asked, in rather a
frightened tone, as she looked round in all
directions to see where the danger could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> way!&rdquo; said Bruno, carefully turning
her round with her face to the wood. &ldquo;Now,
walk backwards&mdash;walk gently&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
frightened: oo sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t trip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sylvie <i>did</i> trip notwithstanding: in fact
he led her, in his hurry, across so many little
sticks and stones, that it was really a wonder
the poor child could keep on her feet at all.
But he was far too much excited to think of
what he was doing.</p>
<p>I silently pointed out to Bruno the best place
to lead her to, so as to get a view of the whole
garden at once: it was a little rising ground,
about the height of a potato; and, when they
had mounted it, I drew back into the shade, that
Sylvie mightn&rsquo;t see me.</p>
<p>I heard Bruno cry out triumphantly &ldquo;<i>Now</i>
oo may look!&rdquo; and then followed a clapping
of hands, but it was all done by Bruno himself.
Sylvie was silent&mdash;she only stood and
gazed with her hands clasped together, and I
was half afraid she didn&rsquo;t like it after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Bruno too was watching her anxiously, and
when she jumped down off the mound, and
began wandering up and down the little walks,
he cautiously followed her about, evidently
anxious that she should form her own opinion
of it all, without any hint from him. And when
at last she drew a long breath, and gave her
verdict&mdash;in a hurried whisper, and without
the slightest regard to grammar&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
loveliest thing as I never saw in all my life
before!&rdquo; the little fellow looked as well pleased
as if it had been given by all the judges and
juries in England put together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you really do it all by yourself,
Bruno?&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;And all for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was helped a bit,&rdquo; Bruno began, with a
merry little laugh at her surprise. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been at it all the afternoon&mdash;I thought oo&rsquo;d
like&mdash;&rdquo; and here the poor little fellow&rsquo;s lip
began to quiver, and all in a moment he burst
out crying, and running up to Sylvie he flung
his arms passionately round her neck, and hid
his face on her shoulder.</p>
<p>There was a little quiver in Sylvie&rsquo;s voice
too, as she whispered &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
matter, darling?&rdquo; and tried to lift up his head
and kiss him.</p>
<p>But Bruno only clung to her, sobbing, and
wouldn&rsquo;t be comforted till he had confessed.
&ldquo;I tried&mdash;to spoil oor garden&mdash;first&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ll never&mdash;never&mdash;&rdquo; and then came another
burst of tears, which drowned the rest of the
sentence. At last he got out the words &ldquo;I
liked&mdash;putting in the flowers&mdash;for <i>oo</i>, Sylvie&mdash;and
I never was so happy before.&rdquo; And
the rosy little face came up at last to be
kissed, all wet with tears as it was.</p>
<p>Sylvie was crying too by this time, and she
said nothing but &ldquo;Bruno, dear!&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>I</i> never
was so happy before,&rdquo; though why these two
children who had never been so happy before
should both be crying was a mystery to <i>me</i>.</p>
<p><i>I</i> felt very happy too, but of course I didn&rsquo;t
cry: &ldquo;big things&rdquo; never do, you know&mdash;we
leave all that to the Fairies. Only I think it
must have been raining a little just then, for
I found a drop or two on my cheeks.</p>
<p>After that they went through the whole garden
again, flower by flower, as if it were a long
sentence they were spelling out, with kisses for
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
commas, and a great hug by way of a full-stop
when they got to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doos oo know, that was my river-edge,
Sylvie?&rdquo; Bruno solemnly began.</p>
<p>Sylvie laughed merrily. &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you
mean?&rdquo; she said. And she pushed back her
heavy brown hair with both hands, and looked
at him with dancing eyes in which the big tear-drops
were still glittering.</p>
<p>Bruno drew in a long breath, and made up
his mouth for a great effort. &ldquo;I mean re-venge,&rdquo;
he said: &ldquo;now oo under&rsquo;tand.&rdquo; And
he looked so happy and proud at having said
the word right at last, that I quite envied him.
I rather think Sylvie didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;under&rsquo;tand&rdquo; at
all; but she gave him a little kiss on each cheek,
which seemed to do just as well.</p>
<p>So they wandered off lovingly together, in
among the buttercups, each with an arm twined
round the other, whispering and laughing as
they went, and never so much as once looked
back at poor me. Yes, once, just before I quite
lost sight of them, Bruno half turned his head,
and nodded me a saucy little good-bye over
one shoulder. And that was all the thanks I
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
got for <i>my</i> trouble. The very last thing I saw
of them was this&mdash;Sylvie was stooping down
with her arms round Bruno&rsquo;s neck, and saying
coaxingly in his ear, &ldquo;Do you know, Bruno,
I&rsquo;ve quite forgotten that hard word. Do say
it once more. Come! Only this once, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bruno wouldn&rsquo;t try it again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">A CHANGED CROCODILE.</span></h2>
<p>The Marvellous&mdash;the Mysterious&mdash;had
quite passed out of my life for the moment:
and the Common-place reigned supreme. I
turned in the direction of the Earl&rsquo;s house, as
it was now &lsquo;the witching hour&rsquo; of five, and I
knew I should find them ready for a cup of tea
and a quiet chat.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully
warm welcome. They were not of
the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-rooms&mdash;who
conceal all such feelings as they may
chance to possess beneath the impenetrable
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
mask of a conventional placidity. &lsquo;The Man
with the Iron Mask&rsquo; was, no doubt, a rarity
and a marvel in his own age: in modern
London no one would turn his head to give
him a second look! No, these were <i>real</i>
people. When they <i>looked</i> pleased, it meant
that they <i>were</i> pleased: and when Lady Muriel
said, with a bright smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>very</i> glad to
see you again!&rdquo;, I knew that it was <i>true</i>.</p>
<p>Still I did not venture to disobey the injunctions&mdash;crazy
as I felt them to be&mdash;of the love-sick
young Doctor, by so much as alluding to
his existence: and it was only after they had
given me full details of a projected picnic, to
which they invited me, that Lady Muriel exclaimed,
almost as an after-thought, &ldquo;and <i>do</i>,
if you can, bring Doctor Forester with you!
I&rsquo;m sure a day in the country would do him
good. I&rsquo;m afraid he studies too much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was &lsquo;on the tip of my tongue&rsquo; to quote
the words &ldquo;His only books are woman&rsquo;s
looks!&rdquo; but I checked myself just in time&mdash;with
something of the feeling of one who has
crossed a street, and has been all but run over
by a passing &lsquo;Hansom.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and I think he has too lonely a life,&rdquo;
she went on, with a gentle earnestness that
left no room whatever to suspect a double
meaning. &ldquo;<i>Do</i> get him to come! And don&rsquo;t
forget the day, Tuesday week. We can drive
you over. It would be a pity to go by rail&mdash;there
is so much pretty scenery on the road.
And our open carriage just holds four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> persuade him to come!&rdquo; I said
with confidence&mdash;thinking &ldquo;it would take all
<i>my</i> powers of persuasion to keep him away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picnic was to take place in ten days: and
though Arthur readily accepted the invitation I
brought him, nothing that I could say would
induce him to call&mdash;either with me or without
me&mdash;on the Earl and his daughter in the
meanwhile. No: he feared to &ldquo;wear out his
welcome,&rdquo; he said: they had &ldquo;seen enough
of him for one while&rdquo;: and, when at last
the day for the expedition arrived, he was so
childishly nervous and uneasy that I thought
it best so to arrange our plans that we should
go separately to the house&mdash;my intention
being to arrive some time after him, so as
to give him time to get over a meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>With this object I purposely made a considerable
circuit on my way to the Hall (as we
called the Earl&rsquo;s house): &ldquo;and if I could only
manage to lose my way a bit,&rdquo; I thought to
myself, &ldquo;that would suit me capitally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this I succeeded better, and sooner, than
I had ventured to hope for. The path through
the wood had been made familiar to me, by
many a solitary stroll, in my former visit to
Elveston; and how I could have so suddenly
and so entirely lost it&mdash;even though I <i>was</i>
so engrossed in thinking of Arthur and his
lady-love that I heeded little else&mdash;was a
mystery to me. &ldquo;And this open place,&rdquo; I said
to myself, &ldquo;seems to have some memory about it
I cannot distinctly recall&mdash;surely it is the very
spot where I saw those Fairy-Children! But
I hope there are no snakes about!&rdquo; I mused
aloud, taking my seat on a fallen tree. &ldquo;I
certainly do <i>not</i> like snakes&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
suppose <i>Bruno</i> likes them, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> like them!&rdquo; said a demure
little voice at my side. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not <i>afraid</i> of
them, you know. But he doesn&rsquo;t <i>like</i> them. He
says they&rsquo;re too waggly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Words fail me to describe the beauty of the
little group&mdash;couched on a patch of moss, on
the trunk of the fallen tree, that met my eager
gaze: Sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in
the moss, and her rosy cheek resting in the
palm of her hand, and Bruno stretched at her
feet with his head in her lap.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/i226.jpg" alt="FAIRIES RESTING" width="500" height="351" />
<p class="center small">FAIRIES RESTING</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too waggly?&rdquo; was all I could say in so
sudden an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not praticular,&rdquo; Bruno said, carelessly:
&ldquo;but I <i>do</i> like straight animals best&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you like a dog when it wags its tail,&rdquo;
Sylvie interrupted. &ldquo;You <i>know</i> you do, Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s more of a dog, isn&rsquo;t there, Mister
Sir?&rdquo; Bruno appealed to me. &ldquo;<i>You</i> wouldn&rsquo;t
like to have a dog if it hadn&rsquo;t got nuffin but
a head and a tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I admitted that a dog of that kind would be
uninteresting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> such a dog as that,&rdquo; Sylvie
thoughtfully remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there <i>would</i> be,&rdquo; cried Bruno, &ldquo;if the
Professor shortened it up for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortened it up?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something
new. How does he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a curious machine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Sylvie was
beginning to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>welly</i> curious machine,&rdquo; Bruno broke in,
not at all willing to have the story thus taken
out of his mouth, &ldquo;and if oo puts in&mdash;somefinoruvver&mdash;at
<i>one</i> end, oo know&mdash;and he
turns the handle&mdash;and it comes out at the
uvver end, oh, ever so short!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As short as short!&rdquo; Sylvie echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one day&mdash;when we was in Outland,
oo know&mdash;before we came to Fairyland&mdash;me
and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile. And
he shortened it up for us. And it <i>did</i> look so
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
funny! And it kept looking round, and saying
&lsquo;wherever <i>is</i> the rest of me got to?&rsquo; And
then its eyes looked unhappy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>both</i> its eyes,&rdquo; Sylvie interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not!&rdquo; said the little fellow. &ldquo;Only
the eye that <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> see wherever the rest
of it had got to. But the eye that <i>could</i>
see wherever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How short <i>was</i> the crocodile?&rdquo; I asked,
as the story was getting a little complicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half as short again as when we caught it&mdash;<i>so</i>
long,&rdquo; said Bruno, spreading out his arms
to their full stretch.</p>
<p>I tried to calculate what this would come to,
but it was too hard for me. Please make it out
for me, dear Child who reads this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t leave the poor thing so short
as that, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no. Sylvie and me took it back again
and we got it stretched to&mdash;to&mdash;how much
was it, Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two times and a half, and a little bit more,&rdquo;
said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t like that better than the other
way, I&rsquo;m afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it did though!&rdquo; Bruno put in
eagerly. &ldquo;It <i>were</i> proud of its new tail! Oo
never saw a Crocodile so proud! Why, it could
go round and walk on the top of its tail, and
along its back, all the way to its head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/i229.jpg" alt="A CHANGED CROCODILE" width="500" height="176" />
<p class="center small">A CHANGED CROCODILE</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>quite</i> all the way,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;It
couldn&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but it <i>did</i>, once!&rdquo; Bruno cried triumphantly.
&ldquo;Oo weren&rsquo;t looking&mdash;but <i>I</i> watched
it. And it walked on tipplety-toe, so as it
wouldn&rsquo;t wake itself, &rsquo;cause it thought it were
asleep. And it got both its paws on its tail.
And it walked and it walked all the way along
its back. And it walked and it walked on its
forehead. And it walked a tiny little way down
its nose! There now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a good deal worse than the last
puzzle. Please, dear Child, help again!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe no Crocodile never walked
along its own forehead!&rdquo; Sylvie cried, too
much excited by the controversy to limit the
number of her negatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo don&rsquo;t know the <i>reason</i> why it did it!&rdquo;
Bruno scornfully retorted. &ldquo;It had a welly
good reason. I <i>heerd</i> it say &lsquo;Why <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> I
walk on my own forehead?&rsquo; So a course it
<i>did</i>, oo know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>that&rsquo;s</i> a good reason, Bruno,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> get up that tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shall</i>, in a minute,&rdquo; said Bruno: &ldquo;soon as
we&rsquo;ve done talking. Only two peoples <i>ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i>
talk comfably togevver, when one&rsquo;s getting up
a tree, and the other isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared to me that a conversation would
scarcely be &lsquo;comfable&rsquo; while trees were being
climbed, even if <i>both</i> the &lsquo;peoples&rsquo; were doing
it: but it was evidently dangerous to oppose
any theory of Bruno&rsquo;s; so I thought it best to
let the question drop, and to ask for an account
of the machine that made things <i>longer</i>.</p>
<p>This time Bruno was at a loss, and left it
to Sylvie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a mangle,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;if
things are put in, they get squoze&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Squeezeled!&rdquo; Bruno interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Sylvie accepted the correction, but
did not attempt to pronounce the word, which
was evidently new to her. &ldquo;They get&mdash;like
that&mdash;and they come out, oh, ever so long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; Bruno began again, &ldquo;Sylvie and
me writed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrote!&rdquo; Sylvie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we <i>wroted</i> a Nursery-Song, and the
Professor mangled it longer for us. It were
&lsquo;<i>There was a little Man, And he had a little
gun, And the bullets&mdash;&mdash;</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the rest,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;But would
you say it <i>long</i>&mdash;I mean the way that it came
<i>out</i> of the mangle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the Professor to <i>sing</i> it for you,&rdquo;
said Sylvie. &ldquo;It would spoil it to <i>say</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to meet the Professor,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;And I would like to take you all with me,
to see some friends of mine, that live near
here. Would you like to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the <i>Professor</i> would like to
come,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s <i>very</i> shy. But <i>we&rsquo;d</i>
like it very much. Only we&rsquo;d better not come
<i>this</i> size, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The difficulty had occurred to me already:
and I had felt that perhaps there <i>would</i> be a
slight awkwardness in introducing two such
tiny friends into Society. &ldquo;What size will
you be?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better come as&mdash;common <i>children</i>,&rdquo;
Sylvie thoughtfully replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the easiest
size to manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you come to-day?&rdquo; I said, thinking
&ldquo;then we could have you at the picnic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie considered a little. &ldquo;Not <i>to-day</i>,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got the things ready.
We&rsquo;ll come on&mdash;Tuesday next, if you like.
And now, <i>really</i>, Bruno, you must come and
do your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>wiss</i> oo wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;<i>really</i> Bruno!&rsquo;&rdquo;
the little fellow pleaded, with pouting lips that
made him look prettier than ever. &ldquo;It <i>always</i>
shows there&rsquo;s something horrid coming! And
I won&rsquo;t kiss you, if you&rsquo;re so unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you <i>have</i> kissed me!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed
in merry triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll <i>un</i>kiss you!&rdquo; And he threw
his arms round her neck for this novel, but
apparently not <i>very</i> painful, operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>very</i> like <i>kissing</i>!&rdquo; Sylvie remarked,
as soon as her lips were again free for speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo don&rsquo;t know <i>nuffin</i> about it! It were
just the <i>conkery</i>!&rdquo; Bruno replied with much
severity, as he marched away.</p>
<p>Sylvie turned her laughing face to me.
&ldquo;Shall we come on Tuesday?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;let it be Tuesday next.
But where <i>is</i> the Professor? Did he come with
you to Fairyland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;But he promised he&rsquo;d
come and see us, <i>some</i> day. He&rsquo;s getting his
Lecture ready. So he has to stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At home?&rdquo; I said dreamily, not feeling
quite sure what she had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir. His Lordship and Lady Muriel
<i>are</i> at home. Please to walk this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE THREE BADGERS.</span></h2>
<p>Still more dreamily I found myself following
this imperious voice into a room where the
Earl, his daughter, and Arthur, were seated.
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re come <i>at last</i>!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel,
in a tone of playful reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was delayed,&rdquo; I stammered. Though
<i>what</i> it was that had delayed me I should
have been puzzled to explain! Luckily no
questions were asked.</p>
<p>The carriage was ordered round, the hamper,
containing our contribution to the Picnic, was
duly stowed away, and we set forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>There was no need for <i>me</i> to maintain the
conversation. Lady Muriel and Arthur were
evidently on those most delightful of terms,
where one has no need to check thought after
thought, as it rises to the lips, with the fear
&lsquo;<i>this</i> will not be appreciated&mdash;<i>this</i> will give
offence&mdash;<i>this</i> will sound too serious&mdash;this
will sound flippant&rsquo;: like very old friends, in
fullest sympathy, their talk rippled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we desert the Picnic and
go in some other direction?&rdquo; she suddenly
suggested. &ldquo;A party of four is surely self-sufficing?
And as for <i>food</i>, our hamper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> we? What a genuine
<i>lady&rsquo;s</i> argument!&rdquo; laughed Arthur. &ldquo;A lady
never knows on which side the <i>onus probandi</i>&mdash;the
burden of proving&mdash;lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do <i>men</i> always know?&rdquo; she asked with a
pretty assumption of meek docility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With <i>one</i> exception&mdash;the only one I can
think of&mdash;Dr. Watts, who has asked the
senseless question</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Why should I deprive my neighbour</p>
<p class="t0">Of his goods against his will?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Fancy <i>that</i> as an argument for Honesty! His
position seems to be &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only honest because
I see no reason to steal.&rsquo; And the <i>thief&rsquo;s</i>
answer is of course complete and crushing.
&lsquo;I deprive my neighbour of his goods because
I want them myself. And I do it against his
will because there&rsquo;s no chance of getting him
to consent to it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you one other exception,&rdquo; I
said: &ldquo;an argument I heard only to-day&mdash;and
<i>not</i> by a lady. &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I walk on
my own forehead?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a curious subject for speculation!&rdquo;
said Lady Muriel, turning to me, with eyes
brimming over with laughter. &ldquo;May we know
who propounded the question? And <i>did</i> he
walk on his own forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t remember <i>who</i> it was that said it!&rdquo;
I faltered. &ldquo;Nor <i>where</i> I heard it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was, I hope we shall meet him
at the Picnic!&rdquo; said Lady Muriel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>far</i>
more interesting question than &lsquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> this a
picturesque ruin?&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Aren&rsquo;t</i> those autumn-tints
lovely?&rsquo; I shall have to answer those two
questions <i>ten</i> times, at least, this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the miseries of Society!&rdquo;
said Arthur. &ldquo;Why ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t people let one enjoy
the beauties of Nature without having to
<i>say</i> so every minute? Why should Life be
one long Catechism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as bad at a picture-gallery,&rdquo; the
Earl remarked. &ldquo;I went to the R.A. last May,
with a conceited young artist: and he <i>did</i>
torment me! I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded his
criticizing the pictures <i>himself</i>: but <i>I</i> had to
agree with him&mdash;or else to argue the point,
which would have been worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was <i>depreciatory</i> criticism, of course?&rdquo;
said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the &lsquo;of course&rsquo; at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, did you ever know a conceited man
dare to <i>praise</i> a picture? The one thing he
dreads (next to not being noticed) is <i>to be
proved fallible</i>! If you once <i>praise</i> a picture,
your character for <i>infallibility</i> hangs by a
thread. Suppose it&rsquo;s a figure-picture, and you
venture to say &lsquo;draws well.&rsquo; Somebody measures
it, and finds one of the proportions an
eighth of an inch wrong. <i>You</i> are disposed of
as a critic! &lsquo;Did you say he draws <i>well</i>?&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
your friends enquire sarcastically, while you
hang your head and blush. No. The only
<i>safe</i> course, if any one says &lsquo;draws well,&rsquo; is to
shrug your shoulders. &lsquo;<i>Draws</i> well?&rsquo; you
repeat thoughtfully. &lsquo;Draws <i>well</i>? Humph!&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s the way to become a great critic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus airily chatting, after a pleasant
drive through a few miles of beautiful
scenery, we reached the <i>rendezvous</i>&mdash;a
ruined castle&mdash;where the rest of the picnic-party
were already assembled. We spent an
hour or two in sauntering about the ruins:
gathering at last, by common consent, into a
few random groups, seated on the side of a
mound, which commanded a good view of the
old castle and its surroundings.</p>
<p>The momentary silence, that ensued, was
promptly taken possession of&mdash;or, more correctly,
taken into custody&mdash;by a Voice; a
voice so smooth, so monotonous, so sonorous,
that one felt, with a shudder, that any other
conversation was precluded, and that, unless
some desperate remedy were adopted, we were
fated to listen to a Lecture, of which no man
could foresee the end!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>The speaker was a broadly-built man, whose
large, flat, pale face was bounded on the North
by a fringe of hair, on the East and West by
a fringe of whisker, and on the South by a
fringe of beard&mdash;the whole constituting a
uniform halo of stubbly whitey-brown bristles.
His features were so entirely destitute of
expression that I could not help saying to
myself&mdash;helplessly, as if in the clutches of a
night-mare&mdash;&ldquo;they are only penciled in: no
final touches as yet!&rdquo; And he had a way of
ending every sentence with a sudden smile,
which spread like a ripple over that vast blank
surface, and was gone in a moment, leaving
behind it such absolute solemnity that I felt
impelled to murmur &ldquo;it was not <i>he</i>: it was
somebody else that smiled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you observe?&rdquo; (such was the phrase
with which the wretch began each sentence)
&ldquo;Do you observe the way in which that broken
arch, at the very top of the ruin, stands out
against the clear sky? It is placed <i>exactly</i>
right: and there is <i>exactly</i> enough of it. A
little more, or a little less, and all would be
utterly spoiled!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/i240.jpg" alt="A LECTURE ON ART" width="500" height="483" />
<p class="center small">A LECTURE ON ART</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh gifted architect!&rdquo; murmured Arthur,
inaudibly to all but Lady Muriel and myself.
&ldquo;Foreseeing the exact effect his work would
have, when in ruins, centuries after his
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you observe, where those trees
slope down the hill,&rdquo; (indicating them with a
sweep of the hand, and with all the patronising
air of the man who has himself arranged the
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
landscape), &ldquo;how the mists rising from the
river fill up <i>exactly</i> those intervals where we
<i>need</i> indistinctness, for artistic effect? Here,
in the foreground, a few clear touches are
not amiss: but a <i>back</i>-ground without mist,
you know! It is simply barbarous! Yes, we
<i>need</i> indistinctness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orator looked so pointedly at <i>me</i> as
he uttered these words, that I felt bound to
reply, by murmuring something to the effect
that I hardly felt the need <i>myself</i>&mdash;and that
I enjoyed looking at a thing, better, when I
could <i>see</i> it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; the great man sharply took
me up. &ldquo;From <i>your</i> point of view, that is
correctly put. But for any one who has a
soul for <i>Art</i>, such a view is preposterous.
<i>Nature</i> is one thing. <i>Art</i> is another. <i>Nature</i>
shows us the world as it <i>is</i>. But <i>Art</i>&mdash;as
a Latin author tells us&mdash;<i>Art</i>, you know&mdash;the
words have escaped my memory&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ars est celare Naturam</i>,&rdquo; Arthur interposed
with a delightful promptitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; the orator replied with an
air of relief. &ldquo;I thank you! <i>Ars est celare
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
Naturam</i>&mdash;but that isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo; And, for a
few peaceful moments, the orator brooded,
frowningly, over the quotation. The welcome
opportunity was seized, and <i>another</i> voice
struck into the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a <i>lovely</i> old ruin it is!&rdquo; cried a
young lady in spectacles, the very embodiment
of the March of Mind, looking at Lady Muriel,
as the proper recipient of all really <i>original</i>
remarks. &ldquo;And <i>don&rsquo;t</i> you admire those autumn-tints
on the trees? <i>I</i> do, <i>intensely</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel shot a meaning glance at me;
but replied with admirable gravity. &ldquo;Oh yes
indeed, indeed! <i>So</i> true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it strange,&rdquo; said the young lady,
passing with startling suddenness from Sentiment
to Science, &ldquo;that the mere impact of
certain coloured rays upon the Retina should
give us such exquisite pleasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have studied Physiology, then?&rdquo; a
certain young Doctor courteously enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>yes</i>! Isn&rsquo;t it a <i>sweet</i> Science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur slightly smiled. &ldquo;It seems a paradox,
does it not,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the image
formed on the Retina should be inverted?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> puzzling,&rdquo; she candidly admitted.
&ldquo;Why is it we do not <i>see</i> things upside-down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never heard the Theory, then,
that the <i>Brain</i> also is inverted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <i>indeed</i>! What a <i>beautiful</i> fact! But
how is it <i>proved</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thus</i>,&rdquo; replied Arthur, with all the gravity
of ten Professors rolled into one. &ldquo;What we
call the <i>vertex</i> of the Brain is really its <i>base</i>:
and what we call its <i>base</i> is really its <i>vertex</i>:
it is simply a question of <i>nomenclature</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last polysyllable settled the matter.
&ldquo;How truly delightful!&rdquo; the fair Scientist
exclaimed with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I shall ask our
Physiological Lecturer why he never gave us
that <i>exquisite</i> Theory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give something to be present when the
question is asked!&rdquo; Arthur whispered to me,
as, at a signal from Lady Muriel, we moved
on to where the hampers had been collected,
and devoted ourselves to the more <i>substantial</i>
business of the day.</p>
<p>We &lsquo;waited&rsquo; on ourselves, as the modern
barbarism (combining two good things in such
a way as to secure the discomforts of both and
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
the advantages of neither) of having a picnic
with servants to wait upon you, had not yet
reached this out-of-the-way region&mdash;and of
course the gentlemen did not even take their
places until the ladies had been duly provided
with all imaginable creature-comforts. Then
I supplied myself with a plate of something
solid and a glass of something fluid, and found
a place next to Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>It had been left vacant&mdash;apparently for
Arthur, as a distinguished stranger: but he
had turned shy, and had placed himself next
to the young lady in spectacles, whose high
rasping voice had already cast loose upon
Society such ominous phrases as &ldquo;Man is a
bundle of Qualities!&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Objective is only
attainable through the Subjective!&rdquo;. Arthur
was bearing it bravely: but several faces wore
a look of alarm, and I thought it high time
to start some less metaphysical topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my nursery days,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;when the
weather didn&rsquo;t suit for an out-of-doors picnic,
we were allowed to have a peculiar kind, that
we enjoyed hugely. The table cloth was laid
<i>under</i> the table, instead of upon it: we sat
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
round it on the floor: and I believe we really
enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of
dinner more than we ever did the orthodox
arrangement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it,&rdquo; Lady Muriel replied.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing a well-regulated child hates
so much as regularity. I believe a really
healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy Greek
Grammar&mdash;if only he might stand on his head
to learn it! And your carpet-dinner certainly
spared you <i>one</i> feature of a picnic, which is to
me its chief drawback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chance of a shower?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the chance&mdash;or rather the certainty&mdash;of
<i>live</i> things occurring in combination with
one&rsquo;s food! <i>Spiders</i> are <i>my</i> bugbear. Now my
father has <i>no</i> sympathy with that sentiment&mdash;<i>have</i>
you, dear?&rdquo; For the Earl had caught the
word and turned to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To each his sufferings, all are men,&rdquo; he
replied in the sweet sad tones that seemed
natural to him: &ldquo;each has his pet aversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never guess <i>his</i>!&rdquo; Lady Muriel
said, with that delicate silvery laugh that was
music to my ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>I declined to attempt the impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like <i>snakes</i>!&rdquo; she said, in a
stage whisper. &ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> an unreasonable
aversion? Fancy not liking such a dear,
coaxingly, <i>clingingly</i> affectionate creature as a
snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like <i>snakes</i>!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Is such
a thing possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> like them,&rdquo; she repeated
with a pretty mock-gravity. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not <i>afraid</i>
of them, you know. But he doesn&rsquo;t <i>like</i> them.
He says they&rsquo;re too waggly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was more startled than I liked to show.
There was something so <i>uncanny</i> in this echo
of the very words I had so lately heard from
that little forest-sprite, that it was only by a
great effort I succeeded in saying, carelessly,
&ldquo;Let us banish so unpleasant a topic. Won&rsquo;t
you sing us something, Lady Muriel? I know
you <i>do</i> sing without music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only songs I know&mdash;without music&mdash;are
<i>desperately</i> sentimental, I&rsquo;m afraid! Are
your tears all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite ready! Quite ready!&rdquo; came from all
sides, and Lady Muriel&mdash;not being one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
those lady-singers who think it <i>de rigueur</i> to
decline to sing till they have been petitioned
three or four times, and have pleaded failure
of memory, loss of voice, and other conclusive
reasons for silence&mdash;began at once:&mdash;</p>

<p>Instantly Sylvie seated herself upon a tiny
mushroom, that happened to grow in front of a
daisy, as if it were the most ordinary musical
instrument in the world, and played on the
petals as if they were the notes of an organ.
And such delicious <i>tiny</i> music it was! Such
teeny-tiny music!</p>
<p>Bruno held his head on one side, and listened
very gravely for a few moments until he had
caught the melody. Then the sweet childish
voice rang out once more:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oo may leave off playing <i>now</i>, Sylvie.

<p>&ldquo;He means &lsquo;without <i>accompaniment</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sylvie
whispered, smiling at my puzzled look: and
she pretended to shut up the stops of the
organ.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they all got safe home again,&rdquo; Bruno
said, after waiting a minute to see if <i>I</i> had

remark ought to be made. And I couldn&rsquo;t help
wishing there were some such rule in Society,
at the conclusion of a song&mdash;that the singer
<i>herself</i> should say the right thing, and not leave
it to the audience. Suppose a young lady has
just been warbling (&lsquo;with a grating and uncertain
sound&rsquo;) Shelley&rsquo;s exquisite lyric &lsquo;<i>I arise
from dreams of thee</i>&rsquo;: how much nicer it would
be, instead of <i>your</i> having to say &ldquo;Oh, <i>thank</i>
you, <i>thank</i> you!&rdquo; for the young lady herself
to remark, as she draws on her gloves, while
the impassioned words &lsquo;<i>Oh, press it to thine
own, or it will break at last!</i>&rsquo; are still ringing
in your ears, &ldquo;&mdash;but she wouldn&rsquo;t do it, you
know. So it <i>did</i> break at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I <i>knew</i> it would!&rdquo; she added quietly,

<p>Lady Muriel was the speaker. And, for the
moment, that was the only fact I could clearly
realise. But how she came to be there&mdash;and
how <i>I</i> came to be there&mdash;and how the glass of
champagne came to be there&mdash;all these were
questions which I felt it better to think out in
silence, and not commit myself to any statement
till I understood things a little more clearly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;First accumulate a mass of Facts: and <i>then</i>
construct a Theory.&rsquo; <i>That</i>, I believe, is the
true Scientific Method. I sat up, rubbed my
eyes, and began to accumulate Facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>A smooth grassy slope, bounded, at the
upper end, by venerable ruins half buried in
ivy, at the lower, by a stream seen through
arching trees&mdash;a dozen gaily-dressed people,
seated in little groups, here and there&mdash;some
open hampers&mdash;the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a picnic&mdash;such
were the <i>Facts</i> accumulated by the Scientific
Researcher. And now, what deep, far-reaching
<i>Theory</i> was he to construct from them? The
Researcher found himself at fault. Yet stay!
One Fact had escaped his notice. While all
the rest were grouped in twos and in threes,
<i>Arthur</i> was alone: while all tongues were
talking, <i>his</i> was silent: while all faces were
gay, <i>his</i> was gloomy and despondent. Here
was a <i>Fact</i> indeed! The Researcher felt that
a <i>Theory</i> must be constructed without delay.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel had just risen and left the
party. Could <i>that</i> be the cause of his despondency?
The Theory hardly rose to the
dignity of a Working Hypothesis. Clearly
more Facts were needed.</p>
<p>The Researcher looked round him once
more: and now the Facts accumulated in
such bewildering profusion, that the Theory
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
was lost among them. For Lady Muriel had
gone to meet a strange gentleman, just visible
in the distance: and now she was returning
with him, both of them talking eagerly and
joyfully, like old friends who have been long
parted: and now she was moving from group
to group, introducing the new hero of the
hour: and he, young, tall, and handsome,
moved gracefully at her side, with the erect
bearing and firm tread of a soldier. Verily,
the Theory looked gloomy for Arthur! His
eye caught mine, and he crossed to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very handsome,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abominably handsome!&rdquo; muttered Arthur:
then smiled at his own bitter words. &ldquo;Lucky
no one heard me but you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Forester,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, who
had just joined us, &ldquo;let me introduce to you
my cousin Eric Lindon&mdash;<i>Captain</i> Lindon, I
should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur shook off his ill-temper instantly and
completely, as he rose and gave the young
soldier his hand. &ldquo;I have heard of you,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to make the acquaintance
of Lady Muriel&rsquo;s cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m distinguished for, <i>as
yet</i>!&rdquo; said Eric (so we soon got to call him)
with a winning smile. &ldquo;And I doubt,&rdquo;
glancing at Lady Muriel, &ldquo;if it even amounts
to a good-conduct-badge! But it&rsquo;s something
to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come to my father, Eric,&rdquo; said
Lady Muriel. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s wandering among
the ruins.&rdquo; And the pair moved on.</p>
<p>The gloomy look returned to Arthur&rsquo;s face:
and I could see it was only to distract his
thoughts that he took his place at the side of
the metaphysical young lady, and resumed
their interrupted discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking of Herbert Spencer,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;do you really find no <i>logical</i> difficulty in
regarding Nature as a process of involution,
passing from definite coherent homogeneity to
indefinite incoherent heterogeneity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amused as I was at the ingenious jumble
he had made of Spencer&rsquo;s words, I kept as
grave a face as I could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <i>physical</i> difficulty,&rdquo; she confidently
replied: &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t studied <i>Logic</i> much.
Would you <i>state</i> the difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;do you accept it as
self-evident? Is it as obvious, for instance,
as that &lsquo;things that are greater than the same
are greater than one another&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>my</i> mind,&rdquo; she modestly replied, &ldquo;it
seems <i>quite</i> as obvious. I grasp <i>both</i> truths
by intuition. But <i>other</i> minds may need some
logical&mdash;I forget the technical terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a <i>complete</i> logical argument,&rdquo; Arthur
began with admirable solemnity, &ldquo;we need
two prim Misses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I remember
that word now. And they produce&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Delusion,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es?&rdquo; she said dubiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
seem to remember that so well. But what is
the <i>whole</i> argument called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Sillygism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! I remember now. But I don&rsquo;t
need a Sillygism, you know, to prove that
mathematical axiom you mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to prove that &lsquo;all angles are equal&rsquo;,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course not! One takes such a
simple truth as that for granted!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>Here I ventured to interpose, and to offer
her a plate of strawberries and cream. I felt
really uneasy at the thought that she <i>might</i>
detect the trick: and I contrived, unperceived
by her, to shake my head reprovingly at the
pseudo-philosopher. Equally unperceived by
her, Arthur slightly raised his shoulders, and
spread his hands abroad, as who should say
&ldquo;What else can I say to her?&rdquo; and moved
away, leaving her to discuss her strawberries
by &lsquo;involution,&rsquo; or any other way she preferred.</p>
<p>By this time the carriages, that were to
convey the revelers to their respective homes,
had begun to assemble outside the Castle-grounds:
and it became evident&mdash;now that
Lady Muriel&rsquo;s cousin had joined our party&mdash;that
the problem, how to convey five people
to Elveston, with a carriage that would only
hold four, must somehow be solved.</p>
<p>The Honorable Eric Lindon, who was at
this moment walking up and down with Lady
Muriel, might have solved it at once, no doubt,
by announcing his intention of returning on
foot. Of <i>this</i> solution there did not seem to
be the very smallest probability.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>The next best solution, it seemed to me, was
that <i>I</i> should walk home: and this I at once
proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; said the
Earl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the carriage won&rsquo;t take us
all, and I don&rsquo;t like to suggest to Eric to
desert his cousin so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far from minding it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should
prefer it. It will give me time to sketch this
beautiful old ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you company,&rdquo; Arthur suddenly
said. And, in answer to what I suppose was a
look of surprise on my face, he said in a low
voice, &ldquo;I <i>really</i> would rather. I shall be quite
<i>de trop</i> in the carriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll walk too,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to be content with <i>Eric</i> as your escort,&rdquo;
he added, to Lady Muriel, who had joined us
while he was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be as entertaining as Cerberus&mdash;&lsquo;three
gentlemen rolled into one&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; Lady
Muriel said to her companion. &ldquo;It will be a
grand military exploit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sort of Forlorn Hope?&rdquo; the Captain
modestly suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> pay pretty compliments!&rdquo; laughed
his fair cousin. &ldquo;Good day to you, gentlemen
three&mdash;or rather deserters three!&rdquo; And the
two young folk entered the carriage and were
driven away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will your sketch take?&rdquo; said
Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should like an hour for it.
Don&rsquo;t you think you had better go without me?
I&rsquo;ll return by train. I know there&rsquo;s one in about
an hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that <i>would</i> be best,&rdquo; said the Earl.
&ldquo;The Station is quite close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I was left to my own devices, and soon
found a comfortable seat, at the foot of a tree,
from which I had a good view of the ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very drowsy day,&rdquo; I said to myself,
idly turning over the leaves of the sketch-book
to find a blank page. &ldquo;Why, I thought you
were a mile off by this time!&rdquo; For, to my
surprise, the two walkers were back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came back to remind you,&rdquo; Arthur said,
&ldquo;that the trains go every ten minutes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the Metropolitan
Railway!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> the Metropolitan Railway,&rdquo; the Earl
insisted. &ldquo;This is a part of Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you talk with your eyes shut?&rdquo;
said Arthur. &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the heat makes me so drowsy,&rdquo;
I said, hoping, but not feeling quite sure, that
I was talking sense. &ldquo;Am I awake now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think <i>not</i>,&rdquo; the Earl judicially pronounced.
&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> think, Doctor? He&rsquo;s only got
one eye open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s snoring like anything!&rdquo; cried
Bruno. &ldquo;Do wake up, you dear old thing!&rdquo;
And he and Sylvie set to work, rolling the
heavy head from side to side, as if its connection
with the shoulders was a matter of
no sort of importance.</p>
<p>And at last the Professor opened his eyes,
and sat up, blinking at us with eyes of utter
bewilderment. &ldquo;Would you have the kindness
to mention,&rdquo; he said, addressing me with
his usual old-fashioned courtesy, &ldquo;whereabouts
we are just now&mdash;and <i>who</i> we are, beginning
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it best to begin with the children.
&ldquo;This is Sylvie, Sir; and <i>this</i> is Bruno.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! I know <i>them</i> well enough!&rdquo;
the old man murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>myself</i> I&rsquo;m
most anxious about. And perhaps you&rsquo;ll be
good enough to mention, at the same time,
how I got here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A harder problem occurs to <i>me</i>,&rdquo; I ventured
to say: &ldquo;and that is, how you&rsquo;re to get
back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true!&rdquo; the Professor replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
<i>the</i> Problem, no doubt. Viewed <i>as</i> a Problem,
outside of oneself, it is a <i>most</i> interesting one.
Viewed as a portion of one&rsquo;s own biography,
it is, I must admit, very distressing!&rdquo; He
groaned, but instantly added, with a chuckle,
&ldquo;As to <i>myself</i>, I think you mentioned that I
am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&rsquo;re the <i>Professor</i>!&rdquo; Bruno shouted in
his ear. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t oo know <i>that</i>? Oo&rsquo;ve
come from <i>Outland</i>! And it&rsquo;s <i>ever</i> so far
away from here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor leapt to his feet with the
agility of a boy. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no time to
lose!&rdquo; he exclaimed anxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just ask
this guileless peasant, with his brace of buckets
that contain (apparently) water, if he&rsquo;ll be so
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
kind as to direct us. Guileless peasant!&rdquo; he
proceeded in a louder voice. &ldquo;Would you tell
us the way to Outland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guileless peasant turned with a sheepish
grin. &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;way&mdash;to&mdash;Outland!&rdquo; the Professor
repeated.</p>
<p>The guileless peasant set down his buckets
and considered. &ldquo;Ah dunnot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to mention,&rdquo; the Professor hastily
put in, &ldquo;that whatever you say will be used in
evidence against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guileless peasant instantly resumed his
buckets. &ldquo;Then ah says nowt!&rdquo; he answered
briskly, and walked away at a great pace.</p>
<p>The children gazed sadly at the rapidly
vanishing figure. &ldquo;He goes very quick!&rdquo; the
Professor said with a sigh. &ldquo;But I <i>know</i> that
was the right thing to say. I&rsquo;ve studied your
English Laws. However, let&rsquo;s ask this next
man that&rsquo;s coming. He is <i>not</i> guileless, and
he is <i>not</i> a peasant&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know that
either point is of vital importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, in fact, the Honourable Eric Lindon,
who had apparently fulfilled his task of escorting
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
Lady Muriel home, and was now strolling
leisurely up and down the road outside the
house, enjoying a solitary cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I trouble you, Sir, to tell us the
nearest way to Outland!&rdquo; Oddity as he was,
in outward appearance, the Professor was, in
that essential nature which no outward disguise
could conceal, a thorough gentleman.</p>
<p>And, as such, Eric Lindon accepted him instantly.
He took the cigar from his mouth,
and delicately shook off the ash, while he considered.
&ldquo;The name sounds strange to me,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I doubt if I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not <i>very</i> far from <i>Fairyland</i>,&rdquo; the
Professor suggested.</p>
<p>Eric Lindon&rsquo;s eye-brows were slightly raised
at these words, and an amused smile, which he
courteously tried to repress, flitted across his
handsome face. &ldquo;A trifle <i>cracked</i>!&rdquo; he muttered
to himself. &ldquo;But what a jolly old
patriarch it is!&rdquo; Then he turned to the
children. &ldquo;And ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>you</i> help him, little
folk?&rdquo; he said, with a gentleness of tone
that seemed to win their hearts at once.
&ldquo;Surely <i>you</i> know all about it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;How many miles to Babylon?</p>
<p class="t">Three-score miles and ten.</p>
<p class="t0">Can I get there by candlelight?</p>
<p class="t">Yes, and back again!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To my surprise, Bruno ran forwards to him,
as if he were some old friend of theirs, seized
the disengaged hand and hung on to it with
both of his own: and there stood this tall
dignified officer in the middle of the road,
gravely swinging a little boy to and fro, while
Sylvie stood ready to push him, exactly as if
a real swing had suddenly been provided for
their pastime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get to <i>Babylon</i>, oo know!&rdquo;
Bruno explained as he swung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t <i>candlelight</i>: it&rsquo;s <i>daylight</i>!&rdquo;
Sylvie added, giving the swing a push of extra
vigour, which nearly took the whole machine
off its balance.</p>
<p>By this time it was clear to me that Eric
Lindon was quite unconscious of my presence.
Even the Professor and the children seemed to
have lost sight of me: and I stood in the midst
of the group, as unconcernedly as a ghost,
seeing but unseen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly isochronous!&rdquo; the Professor
exclaimed with enthusiasm. He had his watch
in his hand, and was carefully counting Bruno&rsquo;s
oscillations. &ldquo;He measures time quite as accurately
as a pendulum!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">
<img src="images/i268.jpg" alt="&lsquo;HOW PERFECTLY ISOCHRONOUS!&rsquo;" width="500" height="401" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;HOW PERFECTLY ISOCHRONOUS!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet even pendulums,&rdquo; the good-natured
young soldier observed, as he carefully released
his hand from Bruno&rsquo;s grasp, &ldquo;are not a joy <i>for
ever</i>! Come, that&rsquo;s enough for one bout, little
man! Next time we meet, you shall have
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
another. Meanwhile you&rsquo;d better take this
old gentleman to Queer Street, Number&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;ll</i> find it!&rdquo; cried Bruno eagerly, as they
dragged the Professor away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are much indebted to you!&rdquo; the Professor
said, looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it!&rdquo; replied the officer,
raising his hat as a parting salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> number did you say!&rdquo; the Professor
called from the distance.</p>
<p>The officer made a trumpet of his two hands.
&ldquo;Forty!&rdquo; he shouted in stentorian tones. &ldquo;And
not <i>piano</i>, by any means!&rdquo; he added to himself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mad world, my masters, a mad
world!&rdquo; He lit another cigar, and strolled
on towards his hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely evening!&rdquo; I said, joining
him as he passed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely indeed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where did <i>you</i>
come from? Dropped from the clouds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strolling your way,&rdquo; I said; and no
further explanation seemed necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks: I&rsquo;m not a smoker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a Lunatic Asylum near here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought there might be. Met a lunatic
just now. Queer old fish as ever I saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, in friendly chat, we took our homeward
ways, and wished each other &lsquo;good-night&rsquo;
at the door of his hotel.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I felt the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling rush
over me again, and saw, standing at the door
of Number Forty, the three figures I knew
so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s the wrong house?&rdquo; Bruno was
saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! It&rsquo;s the right <i>house</i>,&rdquo; the Professor
cheerfully replied: &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the wrong
<i>street</i>. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> where we&rsquo;ve made our mistake!
Our best plan, now, will be to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was over. The street was empty. Commonplace
life was around me, and the &lsquo;eerie&rsquo;
feeling had fled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">HOW TO MAKE A PHLIZZ.</span></h2>
<p>The week passed without any further communication
with the &lsquo;Hall,&rsquo; as Arthur was
evidently fearful that we might &lsquo;wear out our
welcome&rsquo;; but when, on Sunday morning, we
were setting out for church, I gladly agreed
to his proposal to go round and enquire after
the Earl, who was said to be unwell.</p>
<p>Eric, who was strolling in the garden, gave
us a good report of the invalid, who was still
in bed, with Lady Muriel in attendance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming with us to church?&rdquo; I
enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, no,&rdquo; he courteously replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not&mdash;exactly&mdash;in my line, you know. It&rsquo;s an
excellent institution&mdash;for the <i>poor</i>. When
I&rsquo;m with my own folk, I go, just to set them
an example. But I&rsquo;m not known <i>here</i>: so I
think I&rsquo;ll excuse myself sitting out a sermon.
Country-preachers are always so dull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur was silent till we were out of hearing.
Then he said to himself, almost inaudibly,
&ldquo;<i>Where two or three are gathered together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I assented: &ldquo;no doubt that <i>is</i> the
principle on which church-going rests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he <i>does</i> go,&rdquo; he continued (our
thoughts ran so much together, that our conversation
was often slightly elliptical), &ldquo;I suppose
he repeats the words &lsquo;<i>I believe in the
Communion of Saints</i>&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But by this time we had reached the little
church, into which a goodly stream of worshipers,
consisting mainly of fishermen and
their families, was flowing.</p>
<p>The service would have been pronounced by
any modern &aelig;sthetic religionist&mdash;or religious
&aelig;sthete, which is it?&mdash;to be crude and cold:
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
to me, coming fresh from the ever-advancing
developments of a London church under a
<i>soi-disant</i> &lsquo;Catholic&rsquo; Rector, it was unspeakably
refreshing.</p>
<p>There was no theatrical procession of demure
little choristers, trying their best not to simper
under the admiring gaze of the congregation:
the people&rsquo;s share in the service was taken by
the people themselves, unaided, except that a
few good voices, judiciously posted here and
there among them, kept the singing from going
too far astray.</p>
<p>There was no murdering of the noble music,
contained in the Bible and the Liturgy, by its
recital in a dead monotone, with no more expression
than a mechanical talking-doll.</p>
<p>No, the prayers were <i>prayed</i>, the lessons were
<i>read</i>, and&mdash;best of all&mdash;the sermon was <i>talked</i>;
and I found myself repeating, as we left the
church, the words of Jacob, when he &lsquo;<i>awaked
out of his sleep</i>.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Surely the Lord is in this
place! This is none other but the house of God,
and this is the gate of heaven.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, apparently in answer to
my thoughts, &ldquo;those &lsquo;high&rsquo; services are fast
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
becoming pure Formalism. More and more the
people are beginning to regard them as &lsquo;performances,&rsquo;
in which they only &lsquo;assist&rsquo; in the
French sense. And it is <i>specially</i> bad for the
little boys. They&rsquo;d be much less self-conscious
as pantomime-fairies. With all that dressing-up,
and stage-entrances and exits, and being
always <i>en evidence</i>, no wonder if they&rsquo;re eaten
up with vanity, the blatant little coxcombs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we passed the Hall on our return, we
found the Earl and Lady Muriel sitting out in
the garden. Eric had gone for a stroll.</p>
<p>We joined them, and the conversation soon
turned on the sermon we had just heard, the
subject of which was &lsquo;selfishness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a change has come over our pulpits,&rdquo;
Arthur remarked, &ldquo;since the time when Paley
gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue, &lsquo;<i>the
doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of
God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel looked at him enquiringly, but
she seemed to have learned by intuition, what
years of experience had taught <i>me</i>, that the way
to elicit Arthur&rsquo;s deepest thoughts was neither
to assent nor dissent, but simply to <i>listen</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;a great tidal
wave of selfishness was sweeping over human
thought. Right and Wrong had somehow been
transformed into Gain and Loss, and Religion
had become a sort of commercial transaction.
We may be thankful that our preachers are
beginning to take a nobler view of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it not taught again and again in the
<i>Bible</i>?&rdquo; I ventured to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the Bible as a <i>whole</i>,&rdquo; said Arthur.
&ldquo;In the Old Testament, no doubt, rewards and
punishments are constantly appealed to as
motives for action. That teaching is best for
<i>children</i>, and the Israelites seem to have been,
mentally, <i>utter</i> children. We guide our children
thus, at first: but we appeal, as soon as possible,
to their innate sense of Right and Wrong: and,
when <i>that</i> stage is safely past, we appeal to the
highest motive of all, the desire for likeness to,
and union with, the Supreme Good. I think
you will find that to be the teaching of the
Bible, <i>as a whole</i>, beginning with &lsquo;<i>that thy days
may be long in the land</i>,&rsquo; and ending with &lsquo;<i>be
ye perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>We were silent for awhile, and then Arthur
went off on another tack. &ldquo;Look at the
literature of Hymns, now. How cankered it
is, through and through, with selfishness!
There are few human compositions more utterly
degraded than some modern Hymns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quoted the stanza</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Repaid a thousandfold shall be,</p>
<p class="t0">Then gladly will we give to Thee,</p>
<p class="t10">Giver of all!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said grimly: &ldquo;that is the typical
stanza. And the very last charity-sermon I
heard was infected with it. After giving many
good reasons for charity, the preacher wound
up with &lsquo;and, for all you give, you will be
repaid a thousandfold!&rsquo; Oh the utter meanness
of such a motive, to be put before men
who <i>do</i> know what self-sacrifice is, who <i>can</i>
appreciate generosity and heroism! Talk of
Original <i>Sin</i>!&rdquo; he went on with increasing
bitterness. &ldquo;Can you have a stronger proof of
the Original Goodness there must be in this
nation, than the fact that Religion has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
preached to us, as a commercial speculation, for
a century, and that we still believe in a God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have gone on so long,&rdquo; Lady
Muriel musingly remarked, &ldquo;if the Opposition
hadn&rsquo;t been practically silenced&mdash;put under
what the French call <i>la cl&ocirc;ture</i>. Surely in any
lecture-hall, or in private society, such teaching
would soon have been hooted down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust so,&rdquo; said Arthur: &ldquo;and, though I
don&rsquo;t want to see &lsquo;brawling in church&rsquo; legalised,
I must say that our preachers enjoy an <i>enormous</i>
privilege&mdash;which they ill deserve, and which
they misuse terribly. We put our man into
a pulpit, and we virtually tell him &lsquo;Now, you
may stand there and talk to us for half-an-hour.
We won&rsquo;t interrupt you by so much as
a <i>word</i>! You shall have it all your own
way!&rsquo; And what does he give us in return?
Shallow twaddle, that, if it were addressed to
you over a dinner-table, you would think &lsquo;Does
the man take me for a <i>fool</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The return of Eric from his walk checked
the tide of Arthur&rsquo;s eloquence, and, after a
few minutes&rsquo; talk on more conventional topics,
we took our leave. Lady Muriel walked with
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
us to the gate. &ldquo;You have given me much to
think about,&rdquo; she said earnestly, as she gave
Arthur her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came in!&rdquo;
And her words brought a real glow of pleasure
into that pale worn face of his.</p>
<p>On the Tuesday, as Arthur did not seem
equal to more walking, I took a long stroll
by myself, having stipulated that he was not
to give the <i>whole</i> day to his books, but was to
meet me at the Hall at about tea-time. On
my way back, I passed the Station just as the
afternoon-train came in sight, and sauntered
down the stairs to see it come in. But there
was little to gratify my idle curiosity: and,
when the train was empty, and the platform
clear, I found it was about time to be moving
on, if I meant to reach the Hall by five.</p>
<p>As I approached the end of the platform,
from which a steep irregular wooden staircase
conducted to the upper world, I noticed two
passengers, who had evidently arrived by the
train, but who, oddly enough, had entirely
escaped my notice, though the arrivals had
been so few. They were a young woman and
a little girl: the former, so far as one could
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
judge by appearances, was a nursemaid, or
possibly a nursery-governess, in attendance on
the child, whose refined face, even more than
her dress, distinguished her as of a higher class
than her companion.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s face was refined, but it was also
a worn and sad one, and told a tale (or so I
seemed to read it) of much illness and suffering,
sweetly and patiently borne. She had a
little crutch to help herself along with: and
she was now standing, looking wistfully up
the long staircase, and apparently waiting
till she could muster courage to begin the
toilsome ascent.</p>
<p>There are some things one <i>says</i> in life&mdash;as
well as things one <i>does</i>&mdash;which come automatically,
by <i>reflex action</i>, as the physiologists
say (meaning, no doubt, action <i>without</i> reflection,
just as <i>lucus</i> is said to be derived &lsquo;<i>a non
lucendo</i>&rsquo;). Closing one&rsquo;s eyelids, when something
seems to be flying into the eye, is one of
those actions, and saying &ldquo;May I carry the
little girl up the stairs?&rdquo; was another. It
wasn&rsquo;t that any thought of offering help
occurred to me, and that <i>then</i> I spoke: the
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
first intimation I
had, of being likely
to make that offer,
was the sound of
my own voice, and
the discovery that
the offer had been
made. The servant
paused, doubtfully
glancing from her
charge to me, and
then back again to
the child. &ldquo;Would
you like it, dear?&rdquo;
she asked her. But
no such doubt appeared
to cross the child&rsquo;s mind: she lifted
her arms eagerly to be taken up. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;
was all she said, while a faint smile flickered
on the weary little face. I took her up with
scrupulous care, and her little arm was at once
clasped trustfully round my neck.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/i280.jpg" alt="THE LAME CHILD" width="500" height="794" />
<p class="center small">THE LAME CHILD</p>
</div>
<p>She was a <i>very</i> light weight&mdash;so light,
in fact, that the ridiculous idea crossed my
mind that it was rather easier going up, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
her in my arms, than it would have been without
her: and, when we reached the road above,
with its cart-ruts and loose stones&mdash;all formidable
obstacles for a lame child&mdash;I found that I
had said &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better carry her over this rough
place,&rdquo; before I had formed any <i>mental</i> connection
between its roughness and my gentle
little burden. &ldquo;Indeed it&rsquo;s troubling you too
much, Sir!&rdquo; the maid exclaimed. &ldquo;She can
walk very well on the flat.&rdquo; But the arm, that
was twined about my neck, clung just an atom
more closely at the suggestion, and decided me
to say &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no weight, really. I&rsquo;ll carry her
a little further. I&rsquo;m going your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse raised no further objection: and
the next speaker was a ragged little boy, with
bare feet, and a broom over his shoulder, who
ran across the road, and pretended to sweep
the perfectly dry road in front of us. &ldquo;Give
us a &lsquo;ap&rsquo;ny!&rdquo; the little urchin pleaded, with
a broad grin on his dirty face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> give him a &lsquo;ap&rsquo;ny!&rdquo; said the little
lady in my arms. The <i>words</i> sounded harsh:
but the <i>tone</i> was gentleness itself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an
<i>idle</i> little boy!&rdquo; And she laughed a laugh of
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
such silvery sweetness as I had never yet heard
from any lips but Sylvie&rsquo;s. To my astonishment,
the boy actually <i>joined</i> in the laugh, as
if there were some subtle sympathy between
them, as he ran away down the road and
vanished through a gap in the hedge.</p>
<p>But he was back in a few moments, having
discarded his broom and provided himself,
from some mysterious source, with an exquisite
bouquet of flowers. &ldquo;Buy a posy, buy a
posy! Only a &lsquo;ap&rsquo;ny!&rdquo; he chanted, with the
melancholy drawl of a professional beggar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> buy it!&rdquo; was Her Majesty&rsquo;s edict,
as she looked down, with a lofty scorn that
seemed curiously mixed with tender interest,
on the ragged creature at her feet.</p>
<p>But this time I turned rebel, and ignored
the royal commands. Such lovely flowers, and
of forms so entirely new to me, were not to
be abandoned at the bidding of any little maid,
however imperious. I bought the bouquet:
and the little boy, after popping the halfpenny
into his mouth, turned head-over-heels, as if
to ascertain whether the human mouth is really
adapted to serve as a money-box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>With wonder, that increased every moment,
I turned over the flowers, and examined them
one by one: there was not a single one among
them that I could remember having ever seen
before. At last I turned to the nursemaid.
&ldquo;Do these flowers grow wild about here? I
never saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but the speech died away on
my lips. The nursemaid had vanished!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put me down, <i>now</i>, if you like,&rdquo;
Sylvie quietly remarked.</p>
<p>I obeyed in silence, and could only ask myself
&ldquo;Is this a <i>dream</i>?&rdquo;, on finding Sylvie and
Bruno walking one on either side of me, and
clinging to my hands with the ready confidence
of childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re larger than when I saw you last!&rdquo;
I began. &ldquo;Really I think we ought to be
introduced again! There&rsquo;s so much of you
that I never met before, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; Sylvie merrily replied. &ldquo;This
is <i>Bruno</i>. It doesn&rsquo;t take long. He&rsquo;s only
got one name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>another</i> name to me!&rdquo; Bruno protested,
with a reproachful look at the Mistress
of the Ceremonies. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Esquire</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I forgot,&rdquo; said Sylvie.
&ldquo;Bruno&mdash;<i>Esquire</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you come here to meet <i>me</i>, my
children?&rdquo; I enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I <i>said</i> we&rsquo;d come on Tuesday,&rdquo;
Sylvie explained. &ldquo;Are we the proper size
for common children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the right size for <i>children</i>,&rdquo; I replied,
(adding mentally &ldquo;though not <i>common</i> children,
by any means!&rdquo;) &ldquo;But what became of the
nursemaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It are <i>gone</i>!&rdquo; Bruno solemnly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t solid, like Sylvie and you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Oo couldn&rsquo;t <i>touch</i> it, oo know. If
oo walked <i>at</i> it, oo&rsquo;d go right froo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite expected you&rsquo;d find it out, once,&rdquo;
said Sylvie. &ldquo;Bruno ran it against a telegraph
post, by accident. And it went in two
halves. But you were looking the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that I had indeed missed an opportunity:
to witness such an event as a nursemaid
going &lsquo;in two halves&rsquo; does not occur twice
in a life-time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did oo guess it were Sylvie?&rdquo; Bruno
enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/i285.jpg" alt="&lsquo;IT WENT IN TWO HALVES&rsquo;" width="500" height="605" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;IT WENT IN TWO HALVES&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t guess it, till it <i>was</i> Sylvie,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;But how did you manage the nursemaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bruno</i> managed it,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
called a Phlizz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you make a Phlizz, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor teached me how,&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;First oo takes a lot of air&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Bruno</i>!&rdquo; Sylvie interposed. &ldquo;The Professor
said you weren&rsquo;t to tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who did her <i>voice</i>?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it&rsquo;s troubling you too much, Sir!
She can walk very well on the flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno laughed merrily as I turned hastily
from side to side, looking in all directions for
the speaker. &ldquo;That were <i>me</i>!&rdquo; he gleefully
proclaimed, in his own voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can indeed walk very well on the flat,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;And I think <i>I</i> was the Flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we were near the Hall. &ldquo;This
is where my friends live,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Will you
come in and have some tea with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno gave a little jump of joy: and Sylvie
said &ldquo;Yes, please. You&rsquo;d like some tea, Bruno,
wouldn&rsquo;t you? He hasn&rsquo;t tasted <i>tea</i>,&rdquo; she explained
to me, &ldquo;since we left Outland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>that</i> weren&rsquo;t <i>good</i> tea!&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;It were so <i>welly</i> weak!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO.</span></h2>
<p>Lady Muriel&rsquo;s smile of welcome could not
<i>quite</i> conceal the look of surprise with which
she regarded my new companions.</p>
<p>I presented them in due form. &ldquo;This is
<i>Sylvie</i>, Lady Muriel. And this is <i>Bruno</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any surname?&rdquo; she enquired, her eyes
twinkling with fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said gravely. &ldquo;No surname.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, evidently thinking I said it
in fun; and stooped to kiss the children&mdash;a
salute to which <i>Bruno</i> submitted with reluctance:
<i>Sylvie</i> returned it with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>While she and Arthur (who had arrived before
me) supplied the children with tea and
cake, I tried to engage the Earl in conversation:
but he was restless and <i>distrait</i>, and we
made little progress. At last, by a sudden
question, he betrayed the cause of his disquiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Would</i> you let me look at those flowers you
have in your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly!&rdquo; I said, handing him the bouquet.
Botany was, I knew, a favourite study of
his: and these flowers were to me so entirely
new and mysterious, that I was really curious
to see what a botanist would say of them.</p>
<p>They did <i>not</i> diminish his disquiet. On the
contrary, he became every moment more excited
as he turned them over. &ldquo;<i>These</i> are all
from Central India!&rdquo; he said, laying aside part
of the bouquet. &ldquo;They are rare, even there:
and I have never seen them in any other part
of the world. <i>These</i> two are Mexican&mdash;<i>This</i>
one&mdash;&rdquo; (He rose hastily, and carried it to the
window, to examine it in a better light, the
flush of excitement mounting to his very forehead)
&ldquo;&mdash;is, I am nearly sure&mdash;but I have
a book of Indian Botany here&mdash;&rdquo; He took a
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
volume from the book-shelves, and turned the
leaves with trembling fingers. &ldquo;Yes! Compare
it with this picture! It is the exact
duplicate! This is the flower of the Upas-tree,
which usually grows only in the depths
of forests; and the flower fades so quickly
after being plucked, that it is scarcely possible
to keep its form or colour even so far as the
outskirts of the forest! Yet this is in full
bloom! <i>Where</i> did you get these flowers?&rdquo;
he added with breathless eagerness.</p>
<p>I glanced at Sylvie, who, gravely and silently,
laid her finger on her lips, then beckoned to
Bruno to follow her, and ran out into the
garden; and I found myself in the position of
a defendant whose two most important witnesses
have been suddenly taken away. &ldquo;Let
me give you the flowers!&rdquo; I stammered out
at last, quite &lsquo;at my wit&rsquo;s end&rsquo; as to how to
get out of the difficulty. &ldquo;You know much
more about them than I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept them most gratefully! But you
have not yet told me&mdash;&rdquo; the Earl was beginning,
when we were interrupted, to my great
relief, by the arrival of Eric Lindon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>To <i>Arthur</i>, however, the new-comer was, I
saw clearly, anything but welcome. His face
clouded over: he drew a little back from the
circle, and took no further part in the conversation,
which was wholly maintained, for some
minutes, by Lady Muriel and her lively cousin,
who were discussing some new music that had
just arrived from London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do just try this one!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;The
music looks easy to sing at sight, and the
song&rsquo;s quite appropriate to the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose it&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Five o&rsquo;clock tea!</p>
<p class="t0">Ever to thee</p>
<p class="t0">Faithful I&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p class="t0">Five o&rsquo;clock tea!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>laughed Lady Muriel, as she sat down to the
piano, and lightly struck a few random chords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite: and yet it <i>is</i> a kind of &lsquo;ever
to thee faithful I&rsquo;ll be!&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a pair of hapless
lovers: <i>he</i> crosses the briny deep: and <i>she</i>
is left lamenting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is <i>indeed</i> appropriate!&rdquo; she replied
mockingly, as he placed the song before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;And am <i>I</i> to do the lamenting? And who
for, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She played the air once or twice through,
first in quick, and finally in slow, time; and
then gave us the whole song with as much
graceful ease as if she had been familiar with
it all her life:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He stept so lightly to the land,</p>
<p class="t">All in his manly pride:</p>
<p class="t0">He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand,</p>
<p class="t">Yet still she glanced aside.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Too gay he seems,&rsquo; she darkly dreams,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Too gallant and too gay</p>
<p class="t0">To think of me&mdash;poor simple me&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">When he is far away!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I bring my Love this goodly pearl</p>

<p class="t">That ever sailor wed!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">She clasps it tight: her eyes are bright:</p>
<p class="t">Her throbbing heart would say</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;He thought of me&mdash;he thought of me&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>

<p class="t0">Yet there&rsquo;s a smile upon her face,</p>
<p class="t">A smile that seems to say</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll think of me&mdash;he&rsquo;ll think of me&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">When he is far away!</p>

<p class="t0">And I will trust my sailor-lad,</p>
<p class="t">For ever and a day,</p>
<p class="t0">To think of me&mdash;to think of me&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">When he is far away!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The look of displeasure, which had begun
to come over Arthur&rsquo;s face when the young
Captain spoke of Love so lightly, faded away
as the song proceeded, and he listened with
evident delight. But his face darkened again
when Eric demurely remarked &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think &lsquo;my <i>soldier</i>-lad&rsquo; would have fitted the
tune just as well!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so it would!&rdquo; Lady Muriel gaily
retorted. &ldquo;Soldiers, sailors, tinkers, tailors,
what a lot of words would fit in! I think
&lsquo;my <i>tinker</i>-lad&rsquo; sounds best. Don&rsquo;t <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To spare my friend further pain, I rose to
go, just as the Earl was beginning to repeat
his particularly embarrassing question about
the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve <i>had</i> some tea, thank you!&rdquo; I
hastily interrupted him. &ldquo;And now we really
<i>must</i> be going. Good evening, Lady Muriel!&rdquo;
And we made our adieux, and escaped, while
the Earl was still absorbed in examining the
mysterious bouquet.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel accompanied us to the door.
&ldquo;You <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have given my father a more
acceptable present!&rdquo; she said, warmly. &ldquo;He
is so passionately fond of Botany. I&rsquo;m afraid
<i>I</i> know nothing of the <i>theory</i> of it, but I keep
his <i>Hortus Siccus</i> in order. I must get some
sheets of blotting-paper, and dry these new
treasures for him before they fade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> won&rsquo;t be no good at all!&rdquo; said Bruno,
who was waiting for us in the garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You know I <i>had</i>
to give the flowers, to stop questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;but
they <i>will</i> be sorry when they find them gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know <i>how</i>. But they <i>will</i> go.
The nosegay was only a <i>Phlizz</i>, you know.
Bruno made it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were in a whisper, as she
evidently did not wish Arthur to hear. But of
this there seemed to be little risk: he hardly
seemed to notice the children, but paced on,
silent and abstracted; and when, at the entrance
to the wood, they bid us a hasty farewell and
ran off, he seemed to wake out of a day-dream.</p>
<p>The bouquet vanished, as Sylvie had predicted;
and when, a day or two afterwards,
Arthur and I once more visited the Hall, we
found the Earl and his daughter, with the old
housekeeper, out in the garden, examining the
fastenings of the drawing-room window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are holding an Inquest,&rdquo; Lady Muriel
said, advancing to meet us: &ldquo;and we admit
you, as Accessories before the Fact, to tell us
all you know about those flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Accessories before the Fact decline to
answer <i>any</i> questions,&rdquo; I gravely replied. &ldquo;And
they reserve their defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, turn Queen&rsquo;s Evidence, please!
The flowers have disappeared in the night,&rdquo;
she went on, turning to Arthur, &ldquo;and we are
<i>quite</i> sure no one in the house has meddled
with them. Somebody must have entered by
the window&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the fastenings have not been tampered
with,&rdquo; said the Earl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been while you were dining,
my Lady,&rdquo; said the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was it,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;The thief
must have seen you bring the flowers,&rdquo; turning
to me, &ldquo;and have noticed that you did <i>not</i>
take them away. And he must have known
their great value&mdash;they are simply <i>priceless</i>!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, in sudden excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never told us how you got them!&rdquo;
said Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; I stammered, &ldquo;I may be free
to tell you. Just now, would you excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl looked disappointed, but kindly
said &ldquo;Very well, we will ask no questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>

<p class="center small">FIVE O&rsquo;CLOCK TEA</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we consider you a <i>very</i> bad Queen&rsquo;s
Evidence,&rdquo; Lady Muriel added playfully, as
we entered the arbour. &ldquo;We pronounce you
to be an accomplice: and we sentence you to
solitary confinement, and to be fed on bread
and&mdash;butter. Do you take sugar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is disquieting, certainly,&rdquo; she resumed,
when all &lsquo;creature-comforts&rsquo; had been duly
supplied, &ldquo;to find that the house has been
entered by a thief&mdash;in this out-of-the-way
place. If only the flowers had been <i>eatables</i>,
one might have suspected a thief of quite
another shape&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that universal explanation for all
mysterious disappearances, &lsquo;the <i>cat</i> did it&rsquo;?&rdquo;
said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;What a convenient
thing it would be if all thieves had the same
shape! It&rsquo;s so confusing to have some of
them quadrupeds and others bipeds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has occurred to me,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;as
a curious problem in Teleology&mdash;the Science
of Final Causes,&rdquo; he added, in answer to an
enquiring look from Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a Final Cause is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose we say&mdash;the last of a series
of connected events&mdash;each of the series being
the cause of the next&mdash;for whose sake the first
event takes place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the last event is practically an <i>effect</i> of
the first, isn&rsquo;t it? And yet you call it a <i>cause</i>
of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur pondered a moment. &ldquo;The words
are rather confusing, I grant you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Will this do? The last event is an effect
of the first: but the <i>necessity</i> for that event is
a cause of the <i>necessity</i> for the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems clear enough,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel. &ldquo;Now let us have the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely this. What object can we
imagine in the arrangement by which each
different size (roughly speaking) of living creatures
has its special shape? For instance, the
human race has one kind of shape&mdash;bipeds.
Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse,
are quadrupeds. Go down a step or two
further, and you come to insects with six legs&mdash;hexapods&mdash;a
beautiful name, is it not?
But beauty, in our sense of the word, seems to
diminish as we go down: the creature becomes
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
more&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; of any of God&rsquo;s
creatures&mdash;more uncouth. And, when we take
the microscope, and go a few steps lower still,
we come upon animalcul&aelig;, terribly uncouth,
and with a terrible number of legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other alternative,&rdquo; said the Earl,
&ldquo;would be a <i>diminuendo</i> series of repetitions
of the same type. Never mind the monotony
of it: let&rsquo;s see how it would work in other
ways. Begin with the race of men, and the
creatures they require: let us say horses, cattle,
sheep, and dogs&mdash;we don&rsquo;t exactly require
frogs and spiders, do we, Muriel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Muriel shuddered perceptibly: it was
evidently a painful subject. &ldquo;We can dispense
with <i>them</i>,&rdquo; she said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then we&rsquo;ll have a second race of men,
half-a-yard high&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;who would have <i>one</i> source of exquisite
enjoyment, not possessed by ordinary
men!&rdquo; Arthur interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> source?&rdquo; said the Earl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the grandeur of scenery! Surely
the grandeur of a mountain, to <i>me</i>, depends
on its <i>size</i>, relative to me? Double the height
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
of the mountain, and of course it&rsquo;s twice as
grand. Halve <i>my</i> height, and you produce
the same effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy, happy, happy Small!&rdquo; Lady Muriel
murmured rapturously. &ldquo;None but the Short,
none but the Short, none but the Short enjoy
the Tall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me go on,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have a third race of men, five inches high; a
fourth race, an inch high&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t eat common beef and mutton,
I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; Lady Muriel interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my child, I was forgetting. Each
set must have its own cattle and sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And its own vegetation,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;What
could a cow, an inch high, do with grass that
waved far above its head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. We must have a pasture
within a pasture, so to speak. The common
grass would serve our inch-high cows as a
green forest of palms, while round the root of
each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of
microscopic grass. Yes, I think our scheme
will work fairly well. And it would be very
interesting, coming into contact with the races
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
below us. What sweet little things the inch-high
bull-dogs would be! I doubt if even
<i>Muriel</i> would run away from one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to have a
<i>crescendo</i> series, as well?&rdquo; said Lady Muriel.
&ldquo;Only fancy being a hundred yards high!
One could use an elephant as a paper-weight,
and a crocodile as a pair of scissors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you have races of different sizes
communicate with one another?&rdquo; I enquired.
&ldquo;Would they make war on one another, for
instance, or enter into treaties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>War</i> we must exclude, I think. When you
could crush a whole nation with one blow of
your fist, you couldn&rsquo;t conduct war on equal
terms. But anything, involving a collision of
<i>minds</i> only, would be possible in our ideal
world&mdash;for of course we must allow <i>mental</i>
powers to all, irrespective of size. Perhaps
the fairest rule would be that, the <i>smaller</i>
the race, the <i>greater</i> should be its intellectual
development!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel,
&ldquo;that these manikins of an inch high are to
<i>argue</i> with me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, surely!&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;An argument
doesn&rsquo;t depend for its logical force on
the <i>size</i> of the creature that utters it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tossed her head indignantly. &ldquo;I would
<i>not</i> argue with any man less than six inches
high!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d make him <i>work</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What at?&rdquo; said Arthur, listening to all
this nonsense with an amused smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Embroidery!</i>&rdquo; she readily replied. &ldquo;What
<i>lovely</i> embroidery they would do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, if they did it wrong,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you
couldn&rsquo;t <i>argue</i> the question. I don&rsquo;t know
<i>why</i>: but I agree that it couldn&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason is,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, &ldquo;one
couldn&rsquo;t sacrifice one&rsquo;s <i>dignity</i> so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course one couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; echoed Arthur.
&ldquo;Any more than one could argue with a potato.
It would be altogether&mdash;excuse the ancient
pun&mdash;<i>infra dig.</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Even a pun doesn&rsquo;t
<i>quite</i> convince me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that is <i>not</i> the reason,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel, &ldquo;what reason would you give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried hard to understand the meaning of
this question: but the persistent humming of
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
the bees confused me, and there was a drowsiness
in the air that made every thought stop
and go to sleep before it had got well thought
out: so all I could say was &ldquo;That must depend
on the <i>weight</i> of the potato.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt the remark was not so sensible as I
should have liked it to be. But Lady Muriel
seemed to take it quite as a matter of course.
&ldquo;In that case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but suddenly
started, and turned away to listen. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you hear him?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crying. We
must go to him, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said to myself &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very strange!
I quite thought it was <i>Lady Muriel</i> talking to
me. Why, it&rsquo;s <i>Sylvie</i> all the while!&rdquo; And I
made another great effort to say something
that should have some meaning in it. &ldquo;Is it
about the potato?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE IVORY DOOR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;Hush! I
must think. I could go to him, by myself, well
enough. But I want <i>you</i> to come too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;I can
walk as fast as <i>you</i> can, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie laughed merrily. &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Why, you ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t walk a bit! You&rsquo;re
lying quite flat on your back! You don&rsquo;t
understand these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can walk as well as <i>you</i> can,&rdquo; I repeated.
And I tried my best to walk a few steps: but
the ground slipped away backwards, quite as
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
fast as I could walk, so that I made no progress
at all. Sylvie laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I told you so! You&rsquo;ve no idea how
funny you look, moving your feet about in the
air, as if you were walking! Wait a bit. I&rsquo;ll
ask the Professor what we&rsquo;d better do.&rdquo; And
she knocked at his study-door.</p>
<p>The door opened, and the Professor looked
out. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that crying I heard just now?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Is it a human animal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy,&rdquo; Sylvie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve been teasing him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>indeed</i> I haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sylvie said, very
earnestly. &ldquo;I <i>never</i> tease him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must ask the Other Professor
about it.&rdquo; He went back into the study, and
we heard him whispering &ldquo;small human animal&mdash;says
she hasn&rsquo;t been teasing him&mdash;the
kind that&rsquo;s called Boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her <i>which</i> Boy,&rdquo; said a new voice.
The Professor came out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Which</i> Boy is it that you haven&rsquo;t been
teasing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes.
&ldquo;You dear old thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed, standing
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
on tiptoe to kiss him, while he gravely
stooped to receive the salute. &ldquo;How you <i>do</i>
puzzle me! Why, there are <i>several</i> boys I
haven&rsquo;t been teasing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor returned to his friend: and
this time the voice said &ldquo;Tell her to bring
them here&mdash;<i>all</i> of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, and I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sylvie exclaimed, the
moment he reappeared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Bruno</i> that&rsquo;s
crying: and he&rsquo;s my brother: and, please, we
<i>both</i> want to go: he ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t walk, you know:
he&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s <i>dreaming</i>, you know&rdquo; (this in a
whisper, for fear of hurting my feelings). &ldquo;<i>Do</i>
let&rsquo;s go through the Ivory Door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him,&rdquo; said the Professor, disappearing
again. He returned directly. &ldquo;He says
you may. Follow me, and walk on tip-toe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difficulty with me would have been, just
then, <i>not</i> to walk on tip-toe. It seemed very
hard to reach down far enough to just touch
the floor, as Sylvie led me through the study.</p>
<p>The Professor went before us to unlock the
Ivory Door. I had just time to glance at the
Other Professor, who was sitting reading, with
his back to us, before the Professor showed us
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
out through the door, and locked it behind us.
Bruno was standing with his hands over his
face, crying bitterly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/i307.jpg" alt="&lsquo;WHAT&rsquo;S THE MATTER, DARLING?&rsquo;" width="500" height="691" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;WHAT&rsquo;S THE MATTER, DARLING?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, darling?&rdquo; said Sylvie,
with her arms round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurted mine self <i>welly</i> much!&rdquo; sobbed
the poor little fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry, darling! How ever <i>did</i> you
manage to hurt yourself so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I managed it!&rdquo; said Bruno, laughing
through his tears. &ldquo;Doos oo think nobody else
but <i>oo</i> ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t manage things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matters were looking distinctly brighter,
now Bruno had begun to argue. &ldquo;Come,
let&rsquo;s hear all about it!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My foot took it into its head to slip&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Bruno began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A foot hasn&rsquo;t got a head!&rdquo; Sylvie put in,
but all in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slipted down the bank. And I tripted
over a stone. And the stone hurted my foot!
And I trod on a Bee. And the Bee stinged
my finger!&rdquo; Poor Bruno sobbed again. The
complete list of woes was too much for his
feelings. &ldquo;And it knewed I didn&rsquo;t <i>mean</i> to
trod on it!&rdquo; he added, as the climax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Bee should be ashamed of itself!&rdquo;
I said severely, and Sylvie hugged and kissed
the wounded hero till all tears were dried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My finger&rsquo;s quite unstung now!&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;Why doos there be stones? Mister
Sir, doos oo know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good for <i>something</i>,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;even
if we don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i>. What&rsquo;s the good of
<i>dandelions</i>, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dindledums?&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re
ever so pretty! And stones aren&rsquo;t pretty,
one bit. Would oo like some dindledums,
Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno!&rdquo; Sylvie murmured reproachfully.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Mister&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; both at
once! Remember what I told you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You telled me I were to say &lsquo;Mister&rsquo; when
I spoked <i>about</i> him, and I were to say &lsquo;Sir&rsquo;
when I spoked <i>to</i> him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not doing <i>both</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I <i>is</i> doing bofe, Miss Praticular!&rdquo;
Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. &ldquo;I wishted to
speak <i>about</i> the Gemplun&mdash;and I wishted to
speak <i>to</i> the Gemplun. So a course I said
&lsquo;Mister Sir&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Bruno,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Course</i> it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;Sylvie
just knows nuffin at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never <i>was</i> an impertinenter boy!&rdquo;
said Sylvie, frowning till her bright eyes were
nearly invisible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there never was an ignoranter girl!&rdquo;
retorted Bruno. &ldquo;Come along and pick some
dindledums. <i>That&rsquo;s all she&rsquo;s fit for!</i>&rdquo; he
added in a very loud whisper to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you say &lsquo;Dindledums,&rsquo; Bruno?
<i>Dandelions</i> is the right word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he jumps about so,&rdquo; Sylvie
said, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Bruno assented. &ldquo;Sylvie
tells me the words, and then, when I jump
about, they get shooken up in my head&mdash;till
they&rsquo;re all froth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with
this explanation. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you going to pick
me any dindledums, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course we will!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;Come
along, Sylvie!&rdquo; And the happy children raced
away, bounding over the turf with the fleetness
and grace of young antelopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t find your way back to
Outland?&rdquo; I said to the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I did!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;We never got
to Queer Street; but I found another way. I&rsquo;ve
been backwards and forwards several times
since then. I had to be present at the Election,
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
you know, as the author of the new Money-Act.
The Emperor was so kind as to wish
that <i>I</i> should have the credit of it. &lsquo;Let come
what come may,&rsquo; (I remember the very words
of the Imperial Speech) &lsquo;if it <i>should</i> turn out
that the Warden <i>is</i> alive, <i>you</i> will bear witness
that the change in the coinage is the <i>Professor&rsquo;s</i>
doing, not <i>mine</i>!&rsquo; I never was so glorified
in my life, before!&rdquo; Tears trickled down his
cheeks at the recollection, which apparently
was not <i>wholly</i> a pleasant one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Warden supposed to be <i>dead</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s <i>supposed</i> so: but, mind you, <i>I</i>
don&rsquo;t believe it! The evidence is <i>very</i> weak&mdash;mere
hear-say. A wandering Jester, with
a Dancing-Bear (they found their way into the
Palace, one day) has been telling people he
comes from Fairyland, and that the Warden
died there. <i>I</i> wanted the Vice-Warden to
question him, but, most unluckily, he and my
Lady were always out walking when the Jester
came round. Yes, the Warden&rsquo;s supposed to
be dead!&rdquo; And more tears trickled down the
old man&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the new Money-Act?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>The Professor brightened up again. &ldquo;The
Emperor started the thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
wanted to make everybody in Outland twice
as rich as he was before&mdash;just to make the
new Government popular. Only there wasn&rsquo;t
nearly enough money in the Treasury to do it.
So <i>I</i> suggested that he might do it by doubling
the value of every coin and bank-note in Outland.
It&rsquo;s the simplest thing possible. I wonder
nobody ever thought of it before! And you
never saw such universal joy. The shops are
full from morning to night. Everybody&rsquo;s
buying everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was the glorifying done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden gloom overcast the Professor&rsquo;s
jolly face. &ldquo;They did it as I went home
after the Election,&rdquo; he mournfully replied. &ldquo;It
was kindly meant&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t like it! They
waved flags all round me till I was nearly
blind: and they rang bells till I was nearly
deaf: and they strewed the road so thick with
flowers that I lost my way!&rdquo; And the poor
old man sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to Outland?&rdquo; I asked, to
change the subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>&ldquo;About five days&rsquo; march. But one <i>must</i> go
back&mdash;occasionally. You see, as Court-Professor,
I have to be <i>always</i> in attendance on
Prince Uggug. The Empress would be <i>very</i>
angry if I left him, even for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, every time you come here, you
are absent ten days, at least?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, more than that!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed.
&ldquo;A fortnight, sometimes. But of
course I keep a memorandum of the exact time
when I started, so that I can put the Court-time
back to the very moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently the Professor drew from his pocket a
square gold watch, with six or eight hands, and
held it out for my inspection. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;is an Outlandish Watch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I should have thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;which has the peculiar property that,
instead of <i>its</i> going with the <i>time</i>, the <i>time</i> goes
with <i>it</i>. I trust you understand me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to explain. So long as it is let
alone, it takes its own course. Time has <i>no</i>
effect upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have known such watches,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>goes</i>, of course, at the usual rate. Only
the time has to go <i>with</i> it. Hence, if I move
the hands, I change the time. To move them <i>forwards</i>,
in <i>advance</i> of the true time, is impossible:
but I can move them as much as a month <i>backwards</i>&mdash;that
is the limit. And then you have
the events all over again&mdash;with any alterations
experience may suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> a blessing such a watch would be,&rdquo;
I thought, &ldquo;in real life! To be able to unsay
some heedless word&mdash;to undo some reckless
deed! Might I see the thing done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure!&rdquo; said the good natured
Professor. &ldquo;When I move <i>this</i> hand back to
<i>here</i>,&rdquo; pointing out the place, &ldquo;History goes
back fifteen minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling with excitement, I watched him
push the hand round as he described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurted mine self <i>welly</i> much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my
ears, and, more startled than I cared to show, I
turned to look for the speaker.</p>
<p>Yes! There was Bruno, standing with the
tears running down his cheeks, just as I had
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
seen him a quarter of an hour ago; and there
was Sylvie with her arms round his neck!</p>
<p>I had not the heart to make the dear little
fellow go through his troubles a second time,
so hastily begged the Professor to push the
hands round into their former position. In a
moment Sylvie and Bruno were gone again,
and I could just see them in the far distance,
picking &lsquo;dindledums.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, indeed!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has another property, yet more wonderful,&rdquo;
said the Professor. &ldquo;You see this little
peg? That is called the &lsquo;Reversal Peg.&rsquo; If
you push it in, the events of the next hour happen
in the reverse order. Do not try it now.
I will lend you the Watch for a few days, and
you can amuse yourself with experiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much!&rdquo; I said as he gave
me the Watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the greatest care of
it&mdash;why, here are the children again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could only but find <i>six</i> dindledums,&rdquo;
said Bruno, putting them into my hands,
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause Sylvie said it were time to go back.
And here&rsquo;s a big blackberry for <i>ooself</i>! We
couldn&rsquo;t only find but <i>two</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you: it&rsquo;s <i>very</i> nice,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And
I suppose <i>you</i> ate the other, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bruno said, carelessly.
&ldquo;<i>Aren&rsquo;t</i> they pretty dindledums, Mister Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very: but what makes you limp so,
my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine foot&rsquo;s come <i>hurted</i> again!&rdquo; Bruno
mournfully replied. And he sat down on the
ground, and began nursing it.</p>
<p>The Professor held his head between his
hands&mdash;an attitude that I knew indicated distraction
of mind. &ldquo;Better rest a minute,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It may be better then&mdash;or it may be
worse. If only I had some of my medicines
here! I&rsquo;m Court-Physician, you know,&rdquo; he
added, aside to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go and get you some blackberries,
darling?&rdquo; Sylvie whispered, with her arms
round his neck; and she kissed away a tear
that was trickling down his cheek.</p>
<p>Bruno brightened up in a moment. &ldquo;That
<i>are</i> a good plan!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thinks my
foot would come <i>quite</i> unhurted, if I eated a
blackberry&mdash;two or three blackberries&mdash;six
or seven blackberries&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p>Sylvie got up hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; she
said, aside to me, &ldquo;before he gets into the
double figures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me come and help you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I
can reach higher up than you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; said Sylvie, putting her hand
into mine: and we walked off together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruno <i>loves</i> blackberries,&rdquo; she said, as we
paced slowly along by a tall hedge, that looked
a promising place for them, &ldquo;and it was so
<i>sweet</i> of him to make me eat the only one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was <i>you</i> that ate it, then? Bruno
didn&rsquo;t seem to like to tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I saw that,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
always afraid of being praised. But he <i>made</i>
me eat it, really! I would much rather he&mdash;oh,
what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; And she clung to my
hand, half-frightened, as we came in sight of a
hare, lying on its side with legs stretched out,
just in the entrance to the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>hare</i>, my child. Perhaps it&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t asleep,&rdquo; Sylvie said, timidly
going nearer to look at it: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s eyes are open.
Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped to an awestruck
whisper, &ldquo;is it <i>dead</i>, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">318</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quite dead,&rdquo; I said, after stooping
to examine it. &ldquo;Poor thing! I think it&rsquo;s been
hunted to death. I know the harriers were out
yesterday. But they haven&rsquo;t touched it. Perhaps
they caught sight of another, and left it
to die of fright and exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunted to <i>death</i>?&rdquo; Sylvie repeated to herself,
very slowly and sadly. &ldquo;I thought hunting
was a thing they <i>played</i> at&mdash;like a game.
Bruno and I hunt snails: but we never hurt
them when we catch them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet angel!&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;How am I
to get the idea of <i>Sport</i> into your innocent
mind?&rdquo; And as we stood, hand-in-hand, looking
down at the dead hare, I tried to put the
thing into such words as she could understand.
&ldquo;You know what fierce wild-beasts
lions and tigers are?&rdquo; Sylvie nodded. &ldquo;Well,
in some countries men <i>have</i> to kill them, to
save their own lives, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;if one tried to kill
<i>me</i>, Bruno would kill <i>it</i>&mdash;if he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and so the men&mdash;the hunters&mdash;get
to enjoy it, you know: the running, and the
fighting, and the shouting, and the danger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;Bruno likes danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, in <i>this</i> country, there aren&rsquo;t any
lions and tigers, loose: so they hunt other
creatures, you see.&rdquo; I hoped, but in vain, that
this would satisfy her, and that she would ask
no more questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hunt <i>foxes</i>,&rdquo; Sylvie said, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;And I think they <i>kill</i> them, too. Foxes are
very fierce. I daresay men don&rsquo;t love them.
Are hares fierce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A hare is a sweet, gentle,
timid animal&mdash;almost as gentle as a lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if men <i>love</i> hares, why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; her
voice quivered, and her sweet eyes were brimming
over with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they <i>don&rsquo;t</i> love them, dear child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All <i>children</i> love them,&rdquo; Sylvie said. &ldquo;All
ladies love them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid even <i>ladies</i> go to hunt them,
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie shuddered. &ldquo;Oh, no, not <i>ladies</i>!&rdquo;
she earnestly pleaded. &ldquo;Not Lady Muriel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>she</i> never does, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;but this is
too sad a sight for <i>you</i>, dear. Let&rsquo;s try and
find some&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>But Sylvie was not satisfied yet. In a
hushed, solemn tone, with bowed head and
clasped hands, she put her final question.
&ldquo;Does <span class="sc">God</span> love hares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> He does! He
loves every living thing. Even sinful <i>men</i>.
How much more the animals, that cannot sin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;sin&rsquo; means,&rdquo; said
Sylvie. And I didn&rsquo;t try to explain it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my child,&rdquo; I said, trying to lead her
away. &ldquo;Wish good-bye to the poor hare, and
come and look for blackberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, poor hare!&rdquo; Sylvie obediently
repeated, looking over her shoulder at it as we
turned away. And then, all in a moment, her
self-command gave way. Pulling her hand out
of mine, she ran back to where the dead hare
was lying, and flung herself down at its side in
such an agony of grief as I could hardly have
believed possible in so young a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling, my darling!&rdquo; she moaned,
over and over again. &ldquo;And <span class="sc">God</span> meant your
life to be so beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, but always keeping her face hidden
on the ground, she would reach out one
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
little hand, to stroke the poor dead thing, and
then once more bury her face in her hands, and
sob as if her heart would break.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/i321.jpg" alt="THE DEAD HARE" width="500" height="349" />
<p class="center small">THE DEAD HARE</p>
</div>
<p>I was afraid she would really make herself
ill: still I thought it best to let her weep away
the first sharp agony of grief: and, after a
few minutes, the sobbing gradually ceased, and
Sylvie rose to her feet, and looked calmly at
me, though tears were still streaming down
her cheeks.</p>
<p>I did not dare to speak again, just yet; but
simply held out my hand to her, that we might
quit the melancholy spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll come now,&rdquo; she said. Very reverently
she kneeled down, and kissed the dead
hare; then rose and gave me her hand, and we
moved on in silence.</p>
<p>A child&rsquo;s sorrow is violent, but short; and it
was almost in her usual voice that she said,
after a minute, &ldquo;Oh stop, stop! Here are some
<i>lovely</i> blackberries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We filled our hands with fruit, and returned
in all haste to where the Professor and Bruno
were seated on a bank, awaiting our return.</p>
<p>Just before we came within hearing-distance,
Sylvie checked me. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell <i>Bruno</i>
about the hare!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my child. But why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears again glittered in those sweet eyes,
and she turned her head away, so that I could
scarcely hear her reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s very
<i>fond</i> of gentle creatures, you know. And he&rsquo;d&mdash;he&rsquo;d
be so sorry! I don&rsquo;t want him to be
made sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>your</i> agony of sorrow is to count for
nothing, then, sweet unselfish child!&rdquo; I thought
to myself. But no more was said till we had
reached our friends; and Bruno was far too
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
much engrossed, in the feast we had brought
him, to take any notice of Sylvie&rsquo;s unusually
grave manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s getting rather late, Professor?&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;I must
take you all through the Ivory Door again.
You&rsquo;ve stayed your full time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t we stay a <i>little</i> longer!&rdquo; pleaded
Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just <i>one</i> minute!&rdquo; added Bruno.</p>
<p>But the Professor was unyielding. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
great privilege, coming through at all,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We must go now.&rdquo; And we followed him
obediently to the Ivory Door, which he threw
open, and signed to me to go through first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming too, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I said to
Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t see us after
you&rsquo;ve gone through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose I wait for you outside?&rdquo; I
asked, as I stepped through the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Sylvie, &ldquo;I think the
potato would be <i>quite</i> justified in asking <i>your</i>
weight. I can quite imagine a really <i>superior</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
kidney-potato declining to argue with any
one under <i>fifteen stone</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a great effort I recovered the thread
of my thoughts. &ldquo;We lapse very quickly into
nonsense!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">CROSSING THE LINE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Let us lapse back again,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel. &ldquo;Take another cup of tea? I hope
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> sound common sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all that strange adventure,&rdquo; I thought,
&ldquo;has occupied the space of a single comma in
Lady Muriel&rsquo;s speech! A single comma, for
which grammarians tell us to &lsquo;count <i>one</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo; (I
felt no doubt that the Professor had kindly put
back the time for me, to the exact point at
which I had gone to sleep.)</p>
<p>When, a few minutes afterwards, we left the
house, Arthur&rsquo;s first remark was certainly a
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
strange one. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been there just <i>twenty
minutes</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve done nothing but
listen to you and Lady Muriel talking: and
yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if <i>I</i> had been
talking with her for an <i>hour</i> at least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he <i>had</i> been, I felt no doubt: only,
as the time had been put back to the beginning
of the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te he referred to, the whole of
it had passed into oblivion, if not into nothingness!
But I valued my own reputation for
sanity too highly to venture on explaining to
<i>him</i> what had happened.</p>
<p>For some cause, which I could not at the
moment divine, Arthur was unusually grave
and silent during our walk home. It could not
be connected with Eric Lindon, I thought, as
he had for some days been away in London:
so that, having Lady Muriel almost &lsquo;all to
himself&rsquo;&mdash;for <i>I</i> was only too glad to hear
those two conversing, to have any wish to
intrude any remarks of my own&mdash;he <i>ought</i>,
theoretically, to have been specially radiant
and contented with life. &ldquo;Can he have heard
any bad news?&rdquo; I said to myself. And, almost
as if he had read my thoughts, he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here by the last train,&rdquo; he said,
in the tone of one who is continuing a conversation
rather than beginning one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Lindon, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Captain Lindon,&rdquo; said Arthur: &ldquo;I
said &lsquo;he,&rsquo; because I fancied we were talking
about him. The Earl told me he comes to-night,
though <i>to-morrow</i> is the day when he
will know about the Commission that he&rsquo;s
hoping for. I wonder he doesn&rsquo;t stay another
day to hear the result, if he&rsquo;s really so anxious
about it as the Earl believes he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can have a telegram sent after him,&rdquo;
I said: &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not very soldier-like, running
away from possible bad news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good fellow,&rdquo; said Arthur:
&ldquo;but I confess it would be good news for <i>me</i>,
if he got his Commission, and his Marching
Orders, all at once! I wish him all happiness&mdash;with
<i>one</i> exception. Good night!&rdquo; (We
had reached home by this time.) &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
good company to-night&mdash;better be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was much the same, next day. Arthur
declared he wasn&rsquo;t fit for Society, and I had
to set forth alone for an afternoon-stroll. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
took the road to the Station, and, at the point
where the road from the &lsquo;Hall&rsquo; joined it, I
paused, seeing my friends in the distance,
seemingly bound for the same goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you join us?&rdquo; the Earl said, after I
had exchanged greetings with him, and Lady
Muriel, and Captain Lindon. &ldquo;This restless
young man is expecting a telegram, and we
are going to the Station to meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is also a restless young woman in
the case,&rdquo; Lady Muriel added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes without saying, my child,&rdquo; said
her father. &ldquo;Women are <i>always</i> restless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For generous appreciation of all one&rsquo;s <i>best</i>
qualities,&rdquo; his daughter impressively remarked,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to compare with a father, is
there, Eric?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousins are not &lsquo;in it,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Eric: and
then somehow the conversation lapsed into
two duologues, the younger folk taking the
lead, and the two old men following with less
eager steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when are we to see your little friends
again?&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;They are singularly
attractive children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">329</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted to bring them, when
I can,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know, myself,
when I am likely to see them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to question you,&rdquo; said the
Earl: &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no harm in mentioning that
Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity!
We know most of the people about here,
and she has been vainly trying to guess what
house they can possibly be staying at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I may be able to enlighten her:
but just at present&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. She must bear it as best she
can. <i>I</i> tell her it&rsquo;s a grand opportunity for
practising <i>patience</i>. But she hardly sees it
from that point of view. Why, there <i>are</i>
the children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So indeed they were: waiting (for <i>us</i>, apparently)
at a stile, which they could not have
climbed over more than a few moments, as
Lady Muriel and her cousin had passed it
without seeing them. On catching sight of us,
Bruno ran to meet us, and to exhibit to us,
with much pride, the handle of a clasp-knife&mdash;the
blade having been broken off&mdash;which
he had picked up in the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall you use it for, Bruno?&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Bruno carelessly replied:
&ldquo;must think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child&rsquo;s first view of life,&rdquo; the Earl
remarked, with that sweet sad smile of his,
&ldquo;is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating
portable property. That view gets
modified as the years glide away.&rdquo; And he
held out his hand to Sylvie, who had placed
herself by me, looking a little shy of him.</p>
<p>But the gentle old man was not one with
whom any child, human or fairy, could be shy
for long; and she had very soon deserted my
hand for his&mdash;Bruno alone remaining faithful
to his first friend. We overtook the other
couple just as they reached the Station, and
both Lady Muriel and Eric greeted the children
as old friends&mdash;the latter with the words &ldquo;So
you got to Babylon by candlelight, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and back again!&rdquo; cried Bruno.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel looked from one to the other
in blank astonishment. &ldquo;What, <i>you</i> know
them, Eric?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This mystery
grows deeper every day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must be somewhere in the Third
Act,&rdquo; said Eric. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect the
mystery to be cleared up till the Fifth Act,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a <i>long</i> drama!&rdquo; was the
plaintive reply. &ldquo;We <i>must</i> have got to the
Fifth Act by this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Third</i> Act, I assure you,&rdquo; said the young
soldier mercilessly. &ldquo;Scene, a railway-platform.
Lights down. Enter Prince (in disguise, of
course) and faithful Attendant. <i>This</i> is the
Prince&mdash;&rdquo; (taking Bruno&rsquo;s hand) &ldquo;and here
stands his humble Servant! What is your
Royal Highness&rsquo;s next command?&rdquo; And he
made a most courtier-like low bow to his
puzzled little friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&rsquo;re <i>not</i> a Servant!&rdquo; Bruno scornfully
exclaimed. &ldquo;Oo&rsquo;re a <i>Gemplun</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Servant</i>, I assure your Royal Highness!&rdquo;
Eric respectfully insisted. &ldquo;Allow me to
mention to your Royal Highness my various
situations&mdash;past, present, and future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did oo begin wiz?&rdquo; Bruno asked,
beginning to enter into the jest. &ldquo;Was oo
a shoe-black?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lower than that, your Royal Highness!
Years ago, I offered myself as a <i>Slave</i>&mdash;as
a &lsquo;<i>Confidential</i> Slave,&rsquo; I think it&rsquo;s called?&rdquo; he
asked, turning to Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>But Lady Muriel heard him not: something
had gone wrong with her glove, which entirely
engrossed her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did oo get the place?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad to say, Your Royal Highness, I did
<i>not</i>! So I had to take a situation as&mdash;as
<i>Waiter</i>, which I have now held for some
years&mdash;haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; He again glanced at
Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvie dear, <i>do</i> help me to button this
glove!&rdquo; Lady Muriel whispered, hastily stooping
down, and failing to hear the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will oo be <i>next</i>?&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My next place will, I hope, be that of
<i>Groom</i>. And after that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t puzzle the child so!&rdquo; Lady Muriel
interrupted. &ldquo;What nonsense you talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;after that,&rdquo; Eric persisted, &ldquo;I hope to
obtain the situation of <i>Housekeeper</i>, which&mdash;<i>Fourth
Act!</i>&rdquo; he proclaimed, with a sudden
change of tone. &ldquo;Lights turned up. Red
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
lights. Green lights. Distant rumble heard.
Enter a passenger-train!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in another minute the train drew up
alongside of the platform, and a stream of
passengers began to flow out from the booking
office and waiting-rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever make <i>real</i> life into a drama?&rdquo;
said the Earl. &ldquo;Now just try. I&rsquo;ve often
amused myself that way. Consider this platform
as our stage. Good entrances and exits
on <i>both</i> sides, you see. Capital background
scene: real engine moving up and down. All
this bustle, and people passing to and fro, must
have been most carefully rehearsed! How
naturally they do it! With never a glance at
the audience! And every grouping is quite
fresh, you see. No repetition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It really was admirable, as soon as I began
to enter into it from this point of view. Even
a porter passing, with a barrow piled with
luggage, seemed so realistic that one was
tempted to applaud. He was followed by an
angry mother, with hot red face, dragging along
two screaming children, and calling, to some
one behind, &ldquo;John! Come on!&rdquo; Enter John,
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
very meek, very silent, and loaded with parcels.
And he was followed, in his turn, by a frightened
little nursemaid, carrying a fat baby, also
screaming. All the children screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital byplay!&rdquo; said the old man aside.
&ldquo;Did you notice the nursemaid&rsquo;s look of
terror? It was simply <i>perfect</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have struck quite a new vein,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;To most of us Life and its pleasures seem
like a mine that is nearly worked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worked out!&rdquo; exclaimed the Earl. &ldquo;For
any one with true dramatic instincts, it is only
the Overture that is ended! The real treat
has yet to begin. You go to a theatre, and pay
your ten shillings for a stall, and what do you
get for your money? Perhaps it&rsquo;s a dialogue
between a couple of farmers&mdash;unnatural in
their overdone caricature of farmers&rsquo; dress&mdash;more
unnatural in their constrained attitudes
and gestures&mdash;most unnatural in their attempts
at ease and geniality in their talk. Go instead
and take a seat in a third-class railway-carriage,
and you&rsquo;ll get the same dialogue done <i>to the
life</i>! Front-seats&mdash;no orchestra to block the
view&mdash;and nothing to pay!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">335</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me,&rdquo; said Eric. &ldquo;There
is nothing to pay on receiving a telegram!
Shall we enquire for one?&rdquo; And he and
Lady Muriel strolled off in the direction of
the Telegraph-Office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Shakespeare had that thought
in his mind,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when he wrote &lsquo;All the
world&rsquo;s a stage&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sighed. &ldquo;And so it is,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;look at it as you will. Life is indeed
a drama; a drama with but few <i>encores</i>&mdash;and
no <i>bouquets</i>!&rdquo; he added dreamily. &ldquo;We
spend one half of it in regretting the things
we did in the other half!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the secret of <i>enjoying</i> it,&rdquo; he continued,
resuming his cheerful tone, &ldquo;is <i>intensity</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not in the modern &aelig;sthetic sense, I
presume? Like the young lady, in Punch, who
begins a conversation with &lsquo;Are you <i>intense</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; replied the Earl. &ldquo;What
I mean is intensity of <i>thought</i>&mdash;a concentrated
<i>attention</i>. We lose half the pleasure we might
have in Life, by not really <i>attending</i>. Take
any instance you like: it doesn&rsquo;t matter <i>how</i>
trivial the pleasure may be&mdash;the principle is
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
the same. Suppose <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are reading the
same second-rate circulating-library novel. <i>A</i>
never troubles himself to master the relationships
of the characters, on which perhaps all
the interest of the story depends: he &lsquo;skips&rsquo;
over all the descriptions of scenery, and every
passage that looks rather dull: he doesn&rsquo;t half
attend to the passages he does read: he goes
on reading&mdash;merely from want of resolution to
find another occupation&mdash;for hours after he
ought to have put the book aside: and reaches
the &lsquo;<span class="small">FINIS</span>&rsquo; in a state of utter weariness and
depression! <i>B</i> puts his whole soul <i>into</i> the
thing&mdash;on the principle that &lsquo;whatever is
worth doing is worth doing <i>well</i>&rsquo;: he masters
the genealogies: he calls up pictures before
his &lsquo;mind&rsquo;s eye&rsquo; as he reads about the scenery:
best of all, he resolutely shuts the book at the
end of some chapter, while his interest is yet at
its keenest, and turns to other subjects; so
that, when next he allows himself an hour at
it, it is like a hungry man sitting down to
dinner: and, when the book is finished, he
returns to the work of his daily life like &lsquo;a
giant refreshed&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the book were really <i>rubbish</i>&mdash;nothing
to repay attention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose it,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;My
theory meets <i>that</i> case, I assure you! <i>A</i> never
finds out that it <i>is</i> rubbish, but maunders on
to the end, trying to believe he&rsquo;s enjoying
himself. <i>B</i> quietly shuts the book, when he&rsquo;s
read a dozen pages, walks off to the Library,
and changes it for a better! I have yet
<i>another</i> theory for adding to the enjoyment of
Life&mdash;that is, if I have not exhausted your
patience? I&rsquo;m afraid you find me a very
garrulous old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; I exclaimed earnestly. And
indeed I felt as if one <i>could</i> not easily tire
of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, that we should learn to take our
pleasures <i>quickly</i>, and our pains <i>slowly</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? I should have put it the other
way, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By taking <i>artificial</i> pain&mdash;which can be
as trivial as you please&mdash;<i>slowly</i>, the result
is that, when <i>real</i> pain comes, however severe,
all you need do is to let it go at its <i>ordinary</i>
pace, and it&rsquo;s over in a moment!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but how about the
<i>pleasure</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, by taking it quick, you can get so
much more into life. It takes <i>you</i> three hours
and a half to hear and enjoy an opera. Suppose
<i>I</i> can take it in, and enjoy it, in half-an-hour.
Why, I can enjoy <i>seven</i> operas, while
you are listening to <i>one</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always supposing you have an orchestra
capable of <i>playing</i> them,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And that
orchestra has yet to be found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled. &ldquo;I have heard an
air played,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and by no means a
short one&mdash;played right through, variations
and all, in three seconds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When? And how?&rdquo; I asked eagerly, with
a half-notion that I was dreaming again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was done by a little musical-box,&rdquo; he
quietly replied. &ldquo;After it had been wound
up, the regulator, or something, broke, and
it ran down, as I said, in about three seconds.
But it <i>must</i> have played all the notes, you
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you <i>enjoy</i> it?&rdquo; I asked, with all the
severity of a cross-examining barrister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he candidly confessed.
&ldquo;But then, you know, I hadn&rsquo;t been trained
to that kind of music!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should much like to <i>try</i> your plan,&rdquo; I said,
and, as Sylvie and Bruno happened to run up
to us at the moment, I left them to keep the
Earl company, and strolled along the platform,
making each person and event play its part
in an <i>extempore</i> drama for my especial benefit.
&ldquo;What, is the Earl tired of you already?&rdquo; I
said, as the children ran past me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Sylvie replied with great emphasis.
&ldquo;He wants the evening-paper. So Bruno&rsquo;s
going to be a little news-boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you charge a good price for it!&rdquo; I
called after them.</p>
<p>Returning up the platform, I came upon
Sylvie alone. &ldquo;Well, child,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s
your little news-boy? Couldn&rsquo;t he get you an
evening-paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to get one at the book-stall at
the other side,&rdquo; said Sylvie; &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s coming
across the line with it&mdash;oh, Bruno, you ought
to cross by the bridge!&rdquo; for the distant thud,
thud, of the Express was already audible.
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
Suddenly a look of horror came over her face.
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s fallen down on the rails!&rdquo; she cried,
and darted past me at a speed that quite defied
the hasty effort I made to stop her.</p>
<p>But the wheezy old Station-Master happened
to be close behind me: he wasn&rsquo;t good for
much, poor old man, but he was good for this;
and, before I could turn round, he had the child
clasped in his arms, saved from the certain
death she was rushing to. So intent was I in
watching this scene, that I hardly saw a flying
figure in a light grey suit, who shot across from
the back of the platform, and was on the line in
another second. So far as one could take note
of time in such a moment of horror he had
about ten clear seconds, before the Express
would be upon him, in which to cross the rails
and to pick up Bruno. Whether he did so or
not it was quite impossible to guess: the next
thing one knew was that the Express had
passed, and that, whether for life or death, all
was over. When the cloud of dust had cleared
away, and the line was once more visible, we
saw with thankful hearts that the child and his
deliverer were safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Eric called to us cheerfully,
as he recrossed the line. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more frightened
than hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig42">

</div>
<p>He lifted the little fellow up into Lady
Muriel&rsquo;s arms, and mounted the platform as
gaily as if nothing had happened: but he was
as pale as death, and leaned heavily on the
arm I hastily offered him, fearing he was about
to faint. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just&mdash;sit down a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
he said dreamily: &ldquo;&mdash;where&rsquo;s Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>Sylvie ran to him, and flung her arms round
his neck, sobbing as if her heart would break.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, my darling!&rdquo; Eric murmured,
with a strange look in his eyes. &ldquo;Nothing to
cry about now, you know. But you very nearly
got yourself killed for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Bruno!&rdquo; the little maiden sobbed.
&ldquo;And he would have done it for me. Wouldn&rsquo;t
you, Bruno?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I would!&rdquo; Bruno said, looking
round with a bewildered air.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel kissed him in silence as she put
him down out of her arms. Then she beckoned
Sylvie to come and take his hand, and signed
to the children to go back to where the Earl
was seated. &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; she whispered with
quivering lips, &ldquo;tell him&mdash;all is well!&rdquo; Then
she turned to the hero of the day. &ldquo;I thought
it was <i>death</i>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thank God, you are
safe! Did you see how near it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw there was just time,&rdquo; Eric said lightly.
&ldquo;A soldier must learn to carry his life in his
hand, you know. I&rsquo;m all right now. Shall we
go to the telegraph-office again? I daresay
it&rsquo;s come by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">343</div>
<p>I went to join the Earl and the children, and
we waited&mdash;almost in silence, for no one
seemed inclined to talk, and Bruno was half-asleep
on Sylvie&rsquo;s lap&mdash;till the others joined
us. No telegram had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a stroll with the children,&rdquo; I said,
feeling that we were a little <i>de trop</i>, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
look in, in the course of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go back into the wood, now,&rdquo;
Sylvie said, as soon as we were out of hearing.
&ldquo;We ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay this size any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will be quite tiny Fairies again,
next time we meet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvie: &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll be children
again some day&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll let us. Bruno&rsquo;s
very anxious to see Lady Muriel again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She are <i>welly</i> nice,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to take you to see her
again,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better give you back
the Professor&rsquo;s Watch? It&rsquo;ll be too large for
you to carry when you&rsquo;re Fairies, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno laughed merrily. I was glad to see
he had quite recovered from the terrible scene
he had gone through. &ldquo;Oh no, it won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;When <i>we</i> go small, <i>it&rsquo;ll</i> go small!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">344</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then it&rsquo;ll go straight to the Professor,&rdquo;
Sylvie added, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t be able to use it
any more: so you&rsquo;d better use it all you can,
<i>now</i>. We <i>must</i> go small when the sun sets.
Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; cried Bruno. But their voices
sounded very far away, and, when I looked
round, both children had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it wants only two hours to sunset!&rdquo;
I said as I strolled on. &ldquo;I must make the best
of my time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">345</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">AN OUTLANDISH WATCH.</span></h2>
<p>As I entered the little town, I came upon
two of the fishermen&rsquo;s wives interchanging
that last word &ldquo;which never was the last&rdquo;:
and it occurred to me, as an experiment with
the Magic Watch, to wait till the little scene
was over, and then to &lsquo;encore&rsquo; it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good night t&rsquo;ye! And ye winna
forget to send us word when your Martha
writes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ah winna forget. An&rsquo; if she isn&rsquo;t
suited, she can but coom back. Good night
t&rsquo;ye!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">346</div>
<p>A casual observer might have thought &ldquo;and
there ends the dialogue!&rdquo; That casual observer
would have been mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;ll like &rsquo;em, I war&rsquo;n&rsquo; ye! <i>They&rsquo;ll</i>
not treat her bad, yer may depend. They&rsquo;re
varry canny fowk. Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, they <i>are</i> that! Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night! And ye&rsquo;ll send us word if
she writes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, ah will, yer may depend! Good
night t&rsquo;ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at last they parted. I waited till they
were some twenty yards apart, and then put
the Watch a minute back. The instantaneous
change was startling: the two figures seemed
to flash back into their former places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t suited, she can but coom back.
Good night t&rsquo;ye!&rdquo; one of them was saying:
and so the whole dialogue was repeated, and,
when they had parted for the second time, I
let them go their several ways, and strolled
on through the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the real usefulness of this magic
power,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;would be to undo some
harm, some painful event, some accident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
I had not long to wait for an opportunity of
testing <i>this</i> property also of the Magic Watch,
for, even as the thought passed through my
mind, the accident I was imagining occurred.
A light cart was standing at the door of the
&lsquo;Great Millinery Dep&ocirc;t&rsquo; of Elveston, laden
with card-board packing-cases, which the driver
was carrying into the shop, one by one. One
of the cases had fallen into the street, but it
scarcely seemed worth while to step forward
and pick it up, as the man would be back
again in a moment. Yet, in that moment, a
young man riding a bicycle came sharp round
the corner of the street and, in trying to avoid
running over the box, upset his machine, and
was thrown headlong against the wheel of the
spring-cart. The driver ran out to his assistance,
and he and I together raised the unfortunate
cyclist and carried him into the shop.
His head was cut and bleeding; and one knee
seemed to be badly injured; and it was speedily
settled that he had better be conveyed at once
to the only Surgery in the place. I helped
them in emptying the cart, and placing in it
some pillows for the wounded man to rest on;
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
and it was only when the driver had mounted
to his place, and was starting for the Surgery,
that I bethought me of the strange power I
possessed of undoing all this harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is my time!&rdquo; I said to myself, as I
moved back the hand of the Watch, and saw,
almost without surprise this time, all things
restored to the places they had occupied at the
critical moment when I had first noticed the
fallen packing-case.</p>
<p>Instantly I stepped out into the street, picked
up the box, and replaced it in the cart: in the
next moment the bicycle had spun round the
corner, passed the cart without let or hindrance,
and soon vanished in the distance, in a cloud
of dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delightful power of magic!&rdquo; I thought.
&ldquo;How much of human suffering I have&mdash;not
only relieved, but actually annihilated!&rdquo; And,
in a glow of conscious virtue, I stood watching
the unloading of the cart, still holding the
Magic Watch open in my hand, as I was
curious to see what would happen when we
again reached the exact time at which I had
put back the hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_349">349</div>
<p>The result was one that, if only I had considered
the thing carefully, I might have
foreseen: as the hand of the Watch touched
the mark, the spring-cart&mdash;which had driven
off, and was by this time half-way down the
street, was back again at the door, and in the
act of starting, while&mdash;oh woe for the golden
dream of world-wide benevolence that had
dazzled my dreaming fancy!&mdash;the wounded
youth was once more reclining on the heap of
pillows, his pale face set rigidly in the hard
lines that told of pain resolutely endured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mocking Magic Watch!&rdquo; I said to myself,
as I passed out of the little town, and took
the seaward road that led to my lodgings.
&ldquo;The good I fancied I could do is vanished
like a dream: the evil of this troublesome
world is the only abiding reality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now I must record an experience so
strange, that I think it only fair, before beginning
to relate it, to release my much-enduring
reader from any obligation he may feel to believe
this part of my story. <i>I</i> would not have
believed it, I freely confess, if I had not seen it
with my own eyes: then why should I expect
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
it of my reader, who, quite possibly, has never
seen anything of the sort?</p>
<p>I was passing a pretty little villa, which
stood rather back from the road, in its own
grounds, with bright flower-beds in front&mdash;creepers
wandering over the walls and hanging
in festoons about the bow-windows&mdash;an easy-chair
forgotten on the lawn, with a newspaper
lying near it&mdash;a small pug-dog &ldquo;couchant&rdquo;
before it, resolved to guard the treasure even
at the sacrifice of life&mdash;and a front-door
standing invitingly half-open. &ldquo;Here is my
chance,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;for testing the reverse
action of the Magic Watch!&rdquo; I pressed the
&lsquo;reversal-peg&rsquo; and walked in. In <i>another</i>
house, the entrance of a stranger might cause
surprise&mdash;perhaps anger, even going so far
as to expel the said stranger with violence:
but <i>here</i>, I knew, nothing of the sort could
happen. The <i>ordinary</i> course of events&mdash;first,
to think nothing about me; then, hearing my
footsteps to look up and see me; and then to
wonder what business I had there&mdash;would be
reversed by the action of my Watch. They
would <i>first</i> wonder who I was, <i>then</i> see me,
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
then look down, and think no more about me.
And as to being expelled with violence, <i>that</i>
event would necessarily come <i>first</i> in this case.
&ldquo;So, if I can once get <i>in</i>,&rdquo; I said to myself,
&ldquo;all risk of <i>expulsion</i> will be over!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/i351.jpg" alt="&lsquo;THE PUG-DOG SAT UP&rsquo;" width="500" height="449" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;THE PUG-DOG SAT UP&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary
measure, as I passed; but, as I took no notice
of the treasure he was guarding, he let me go
by without even one remonstrant bark. &ldquo;He
that takes my life,&rdquo; he seemed to be saying,
wheezily, to himself, &ldquo;takes trash: But he that
takes the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; But this
awful contingency I did not face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">352</div>
<p>The party in the drawing-room&mdash;I had
walked straight in, you understand, without
ringing the bell, or giving any notice of my
approach&mdash;consisted of four laughing rosy
children, of ages from about fourteen down to
ten, who were, apparently, all coming towards
the door (I found they were really walking
<i>backwards</i>), while their mother, seated by the
fire with some needlework on her lap, was saying,
just as I entered the room, &ldquo;Now, girls,
you may get your things on for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my utter astonishment&mdash;for I was not
yet accustomed to the action of the Watch&mdash;&ldquo;all
smiles ceased&rdquo; (as Browning says) on
the four pretty faces, and they all got out
pieces of needle-work, and sat down. No one
noticed <i>me</i> in the least, as I quietly took a
chair and sat down to watch them.</p>
<p>When the needle-work had been unfolded,
and they were all ready to begin, their mother
said &ldquo;Come, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> done, at last! You may fold
up your work, girls.&rdquo; But the children took
no notice whatever of the remark; on the contrary,
they set to work at once sewing&mdash;if that
is the proper word to describe an operation
<span class="pb" id="Page_353">353</span>
such as <i>I</i> had never before witnessed. Each
of them threaded her needle with a short end
of thread attached to the work, which was instantly
pulled by an invisible force through the
stuff, dragging the needle after it: the nimble
fingers of the little sempstress caught it at
the other side, but only to lose it again the
next moment. And so the work went on,
steadily undoing itself, and the neatly-stitched
little dresses, or whatever they were, steadily
falling to pieces. Now and then one of the
children would pause, as the recovered thread
became inconveniently long, wind it on a bobbin,
and start again with another short end.</p>
<p>At last all the work was picked to pieces
and put away, and the lady led the way into
the next room, walking backwards, and making
the insane remark &ldquo;Not yet, dear: we <i>must</i>
get the sewing done first.&rdquo; After which, I
was not surprised to see the children skipping
backwards after her, exclaiming &ldquo;Oh, mother,
it <i>is</i> such a lovely day for a walk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dining-room, the table had only dirty
plates and empty dishes on it. However the
party&mdash;with the addition of a gentleman, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_354">354</span>
good-natured, and as rosy, as the children&mdash;seated
themselves at it very contentedly.</p>
<p>You have seen people eating cherry-tart, and
every now and then cautiously conveying a
cherry-stone from their lips to their plates?
Well, something like that went on all through
this ghastly&mdash;or shall we say &lsquo;ghostly&rsquo;?&mdash;banquet.
An empty fork is raised to the
lips: there it receives a neatly-cut piece of
mutton, and swiftly conveys it to the plate,
where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton
already there. Soon one of the plates, furnished
with a complete slice of mutton and two
potatoes, was handed up to the presiding gentleman,
who quietly replaced the slice on the
joint, and the potatoes in the dish.</p>
<p>Their conversation was, if possible, more
bewildering than their mode of dining. It
began by the youngest girl suddenly, and without
provocation, addressing her eldest sister.
&ldquo;Oh, you <i>wicked</i> story-teller!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I expected a sharp reply from the sister;
but, instead of this, she turned laughingly to
her father, and said, in a very loud stage-whisper,
&ldquo;To be a bride!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_355">355</div>
<p>The father, in order to do <i>his</i> part in a
conversation that seemed only fit for lunatics,
replied &ldquo;Whisper it to me, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> whisper (these children never
did anything they were told): she said, quite
loud, &ldquo;Of course not! Everybody knows what
<i>Dolly</i> wants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And little Dolly shrugged her shoulders, and
said, with a pretty pettishness, &ldquo;Now, Father,
you&rsquo;re not to tease! You know I don&rsquo;t want to
be bride&rsquo;s-maid to <i>anybody</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dolly&rsquo;s to be the fourth,&rdquo; was her
father&rsquo;s idiotic reply.</p>
<p>Here Number Three put in her oar. &ldquo;Oh,
it <i>is</i> settled, Mother dear, really and truly!
Mary told us all about it. It&rsquo;s to be next
Tuesday four weeks&mdash;and three of her cousins
are coming to be bride&rsquo;s-maids&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> doesn&rsquo;t forget it, Minnie!&rdquo; the Mother
laughingly replied. &ldquo;I do wish they&rsquo;d get it
settled! I don&rsquo;t like long engagements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Minnie wound up the conversation&mdash;if
so chaotic a series of remarks deserves the
name&mdash;with &ldquo;Only think! We passed the
Cedars this morning, just exactly as Mary
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">356</span>
Davenant was standing at the gate, wishing
good-bye to Mister&mdash;I forget his name. Of
course we looked the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time I was so hopelessly confused
that I gave up listening, and followed the
dinner down into the kitchen.</p>
<p>But to you, O hypercritical reader, resolute
to believe no item of this weird adventure, what
need to tell how the mutton was placed on the
spit, and slowly unroasted&mdash;how the potatoes
were wrapped in their skins, and handed over
to the gardener to be buried&mdash;how, when the
mutton had at length attained to rawness, the
fire, which had gradually changed from red-heat
to a mere blaze, died down so suddenly
that the cook had only just time to catch its
last flicker on the end of a match&mdash;or how the
maid, having taken the mutton off the spit,
carried it (backwards, of course) out of the
house, to meet the butcher, who was coming
(also backwards) down the road?</p>
<p>The longer I thought over this strange
adventure, the more hopelessly tangled the
mystery became: and it was a real relief to
meet Arthur in the road, and get him to go
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
with me up to the Hall, to learn what news
the telegraph had brought. I told him, as we
went, what had happened at the Station, but
as to my further adventures I thought it best,
for the present, to say nothing.</p>
<p>The Earl was sitting alone when we entered.
&ldquo;I am glad you are come in to keep me company,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Muriel is gone to bed&mdash;the
excitement of that terrible scene was too much
for her&mdash;and Eric has gone to the hotel to
pack his things, to start for London by the
early train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the telegram has come?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not hear? Oh, I had forgotten:
it came in after you left the Station. Yes, it&rsquo;s
all right: Eric has got his commission; and,
now that he has arranged matters with Muriel,
he has business in town that must be seen to
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What arrangement do you mean?&rdquo; I asked
with a sinking heart, as the thought of Arthur&rsquo;s
crushed hopes came to my mind. &ldquo;Do you
mean that they are <i>engaged</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been engaged&mdash;in a sense&mdash;for
two years,&rdquo; the old man gently replied:
<span class="pb" id="Page_358">358</span>
&ldquo;that is, he has had my promise to consent
to it, so soon as he could secure a permanent
and settled line in life. I could never be happy
with my child married to a man without an
object to live for&mdash;without even an object to
die for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they will be happy,&rdquo; a strange voice
said. The speaker was evidently in the room,
but I had not heard the door open, and I
looked round in some astonishment. The Earl
seemed to share my surprise. &ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; said Arthur, looking at us with
a worn, haggard face, and eyes from which the
light of life seemed suddenly to have faded.
&ldquo;And let me wish <i>you</i> joy also, dear friend,&rdquo;
he added, looking sadly at the Earl, and speaking
in the same hollow tones that had startled
us so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the old man said, simply and
heartily.</p>
<p>A silence followed: then I rose, feeling sure
that Arthur would wish to be alone, and bade
our gentle host &lsquo;Good night&rsquo;: Arthur took his
hand, but said nothing: nor did he speak again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_359">359</span>
as we went home, till we were in the house
and had lit our bed-room candles. Then he
said, more to himself than to me, &ldquo;<i>The heart
knoweth its own bitterness</i>. I never understood
those words till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next few days passed wearily enough.
I felt no inclination to call again, by myself,
at the Hall; still less to propose that Arthur
should go with me: it seemed better to wait
till Time&mdash;that gentle healer of our bitterest
sorrows&mdash;should have helped him to recover
from the first shock of the disappointment
that had blighted his life.</p>
<p>Business, however, soon demanded my presence
in town; and I had to announce to
Arthur that I must leave him for a while.
&ldquo;But I hope to run down again in a month,&rdquo;
I added. &ldquo;I would stay now, if I could. I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good for you to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t face solitude, <i>here</i>, for long,&rdquo;
said Arthur. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t think about <i>me</i>. I
have made up my mind to accept a post in
India, that has been offered me. Out there,
I suppose I shall find something to live for; I
can&rsquo;t see <i>anything</i> at present. &lsquo;<i>This life of
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
mine I guard, as God&rsquo;s high gift, from scathe
and wrong, Not greatly care to lose!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;your name-sake bore as
heavy a blow, and lived through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A far heavier one than <i>mine</i>,&rdquo; said Arthur.
&ldquo;The woman <i>he</i> loved proved false. There
is no such cloud as <i>that</i> on my memory of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He left the name unuttered, and
went on hurriedly. &ldquo;But <i>you</i> will return, will
you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall come back for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Arthur: &ldquo;and you shall write
and tell me of our friends. I&rsquo;ll send you my
address when I&rsquo;m settled down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_361">361</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE FROGS&rsquo; BIRTHDAY-TREAT.</span></h2>
<p>And so it came to pass that, just a week
after the day when my Fairy-friends first appeared
as Children, I found myself taking a
farewell-stroll through the wood, in the hope
of meeting them once more. I had but to
stretch myself on the smooth turf, and the
&lsquo;eerie&rsquo; feeling was on me in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put oor ear <i>welly</i> low down,&rdquo; said Bruno,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell oo a secret! It&rsquo;s the Frogs&rsquo;
Birthday-Treat&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve lost the Baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> Baby?&rdquo; I said, quite bewildered by
this complicated piece of news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_362">362</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Queen&rsquo;s</i> Baby, a course!&rdquo; said Bruno.
&ldquo;Titania&rsquo;s Baby. And we&rsquo;s <i>welly</i> sorry.
Sylvie, she&rsquo;s&mdash;oh so sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i> sorry is she?&rdquo; I asked, mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-quarters of a yard,&rdquo; Bruno replied
with perfect solemnity. &ldquo;And <i>I&rsquo;m</i> a little
sorry too,&rdquo; he added, shutting his eyes so as
not to see that he was smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing about the Baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the <i>soldiers</i> are all looking for it&mdash;up
and down&mdash;everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>soldiers</i>?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a course!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;When
there&rsquo;s no fighting to be done, the soldiers
doos any little odd jobs, oo know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was amused at the idea of its being a
&lsquo;little odd job&rsquo; to find the Royal Baby. &ldquo;But
how did you come to lose it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We put it in a flower,&rdquo; Sylvie, who had
just joined us, explained with her eyes full of
tears. &ldquo;Only we ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t remember <i>which</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says <i>us</i> put it in a flower,&rdquo; Bruno
interrupted, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause she doosn&rsquo;t want <i>I</i> to get
punished. But it were really <i>me</i> what put it
there. <i>Sylvie</i> were picking Dindledums.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_363">363</div>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/i363.jpg" alt="THE QUEEN&rsquo;S BABY" width="500" height="765" />
<p class="center small">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S BABY</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
say &lsquo;<i>us</i> put it in
a flower&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sylvie very
gravely remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>hus</i>, then,&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;I never <i>can</i> remember
those horrid H&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help you to look
for it,&rdquo; I said. So Sylvie
and I made a &lsquo;voyage of
discovery&rsquo; among all the
flowers; but there was no
Baby to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of
Bruno?&rdquo; I said, when we
had completed our tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down in the ditch
there,&rdquo; said Sylvie, &ldquo;amusing
a young Frog.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_364">364</div>
<p>I went down on my hands and knees to look
for him, for I felt very curious to know how
young Frogs <i>ought</i> to be amused. After a
minute&rsquo;s search, I found him sitting at the edge
of the ditch, by the side of the little Frog, and
looking rather disconsolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on, Bruno?&rdquo; I said,
nodding to him as he looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t amuse it no more,&rdquo; Bruno answered,
very dolefully, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause it won&rsquo;t say what it
would like to do next! I&rsquo;ve showed it all
the duck-weeds&mdash;and a live caddis-worm&mdash;but
it won&rsquo;t say nuffin! What&mdash;would oo&mdash;like?&rdquo;
he shouted into the ear of the Frog:
but the little creature sat quite still, and took
no notice of him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s deaf, I think!&rdquo; Bruno
said, turning away with a sigh. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s time
to get the Theatre ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the audience to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only but Frogs,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;But they
haven&rsquo;t comed yet. They wants to be drove
up, like sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it save time,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;if <i>I</i>
were to walk round with Sylvie, to drive up the
Frogs, while <i>you</i> get the Theatre ready?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_365">365</div>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>are</i> a good plan!&rdquo; cried Bruno. &ldquo;But
where <i>are</i> Sylvie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; said Sylvie, peeping over the
edge of the bank. &ldquo;I was just watching two
Frogs that were having a race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which won it?&rdquo; Bruno eagerly inquired.</p>
<p>Sylvie was puzzled. &ldquo;He <i>does</i> ask such hard
questions!&rdquo; she confided to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s to happen in the Theatre?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First they have their Birthday-Feast,&rdquo;
Sylvie said: &ldquo;then Bruno does some Bits of
Shakespeare; then he tells them a Story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think the Frogs like the Feast
best. Don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s generally very few of them
that get any. They <i>will</i> keep their mouths
shut so tight! And it&rsquo;s just as well they <i>do</i>,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;because Bruno likes to cook it
himself: and he cooks <i>very</i> queerly. Now
they&rsquo;re all in. Would you just help me to
put them with their heads the right way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We soon managed this part of the business,
though the Frogs kept up a most discontented
croaking all the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_366">366</div>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> they saying?&rdquo; I asked Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying &lsquo;Fork! Fork!&rsquo; It&rsquo;s very
silly of them! You&rsquo;re not going to <i>have</i>
forks!&rdquo; she announced with some severity.
&ldquo;Those that want any Feast have just got
to open their mouths, and Bruno&rsquo;ll put some
of it in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Bruno appeared, wearing a
little white apron to show that he was a Cook,
and carrying a tureen full of very queer-looking
soup. I watched very carefully as he moved
about among the Frogs; but I could not see
that <i>any</i> of them opened their mouths to be fed&mdash;except
one very young one, and I&rsquo;m nearly
sure it did it accidentally, in yawning. However
Bruno instantly put a large spoonful of
soup into its mouth, and the poor little thing
coughed violently for some time.</p>
<p>So Sylvie and I had to share the soup
between us, and to <i>pretend</i> to enjoy it, for it
certainly was <i>very</i> queerly cooked.</p>
<p>I only ventured to take <i>one</i> spoonful of it
(&ldquo;Sylvie&rsquo;s Summer-Soup,&rdquo; Bruno said it was),
and must candidly confess that it was not <i>at
all</i> nice; and I could not feel surprised that
<span class="pb" id="Page_367">367</span>
so many of the guests had kept their mouths
shut up tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the soup <i>made</i> of, Bruno?&rdquo; said
Sylvie, who had put a spoonful of it to her lips,
and was making a wry face over it.</p>
<p>And Bruno&rsquo;s answer was anything but encouraging.
&ldquo;Bits of things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entertainment was to conclude with
&ldquo;Bits of Shakespeare,&rdquo; as Sylvie expressed
it, which were all to be done by Bruno, Sylvie
being fully engaged in making the Frogs keep
their heads towards the stage: after which
Bruno was to appear in his real character, and
tell them a Story of his own invention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the Story have a Moral to it?&rdquo; I
asked Sylvie, while Bruno was away behind
the hedge, dressing for the first &lsquo;Bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>think</i> so,&rdquo; Sylvie replied doubtfully.
&ldquo;There generally <i>is</i> a Moral, only he puts it
in too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will he <i>say</i> all the Bits of Shakespeare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;ll only <i>act</i> them,&rdquo; said Sylvie. &ldquo;He
knows hardly any of the words. When I see
what he&rsquo;s dressed like, I&rsquo;ve to tell the Frogs
<span class="pb" id="Page_368">368</span>
what character it is. They&rsquo;re always in such
a hurry to guess! Don&rsquo;t you hear them all
saying &lsquo;What? What?&rsquo;&rdquo; And so indeed they
were: it had only sounded like croaking, till
Sylvie explained it, but I could now make
out the &ldquo;Wawt? Wawt?&rdquo; quite distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do they try to guess it before they
see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sylvie said: &ldquo;but they
always <i>do</i>. Sometimes they begin guessing
weeks and weeks before the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(So now, when you hear the Frogs croaking
in a particularly melancholy way, you may
be sure they&rsquo;re trying to guess Bruno&rsquo;s next
Shakespeare &lsquo;Bit&rsquo;. Isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> interesting?)</p>
<p>However, the chorus of guessing was cut
short by Bruno, who suddenly rushed on from
behind the scenes, and took a flying leap down
among the Frogs, to re-arrange them.</p>
<p>For the oldest and fattest Frog&mdash;who had
never been properly arranged so that he could
see the stage, and so had no idea what was
going on&mdash;was getting restless, and had upset
several of the Frogs, and turned others round
with their heads the wrong way. And it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_369">369</span>
no good at all, Bruno said, to do a &lsquo;Bit&rsquo; of
Shakespeare when there was nobody to look
at it (you see he didn&rsquo;t count <i>me</i> as anybody).
So he set to work with a stick, stirring them
up, very much as you would stir up tea in a
cup, till most of them had at least <i>one</i> great
stupid eye gazing at the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oo</i> must come and sit among them, Sylvie,&rdquo;
he said in despair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put these two side-by-side,
with their noses the same way, ever so
many times, but they <i>do</i> squarrel so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Sylvie took her place as &lsquo;Mistress of the
Ceremonies,&rsquo; and Bruno vanished again behind
the scenes, to dress for the first &lsquo;Bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamlet!&rdquo; was suddenly proclaimed, in the
clear sweet tones I knew so well. The croaking
all ceased in a moment, and I turned to
the stage, in some curiosity to see what Bruno&rsquo;s
ideas were as to the behaviour of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
greatest Character.</p>
<p>According to this eminent interpreter of the
Drama, Hamlet wore a short black cloak
(which he chiefly used for muffling up his face,
as if he suffered a good deal from toothache),
and turned out his toes very much as he
<span class="pb" id="Page_370">370</span>
walked. &ldquo;To be or not to be!&rdquo; Hamlet
remarked in a cheerful tone, and then turned
head-over-heels several times, his cloak dropping
off in the performance.</p>
<p>I felt a little disappointed: Bruno&rsquo;s conception
of the part seemed so wanting in
dignity. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he say any more of the
speech?&rdquo; I whispered to Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>think</i> not,&rdquo; Sylvie whispered in reply.
&ldquo;He generally turns head-over-heels when he
doesn&rsquo;t know any more words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno had meanwhile settled the question
by disappearing from the stage; and the Frogs
instantly began inquiring the name of the
next Character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know directly!&rdquo; cried Sylvie, as she
adjusted two or three young Frogs that had
struggled round with their backs to the
stage. &ldquo;Macbeth!&rdquo; she added, as Bruno
re-appeared.</p>
<p>Macbeth had something twisted round him,
that went over one shoulder and under the
other arm, and was meant, I believe, for a
Scotch plaid. He had a thorn in his hand,
which he held out at arm&rsquo;s length, as if he
<span class="pb" id="Page_371">371</span>
were a little afraid of it. &ldquo;Is this a <i>dagger</i>?&rdquo;
Macbeth inquired, in a puzzled sort of tone:
and instantly a chorus of &ldquo;Thorn! Thorn!&rdquo;
arose from the Frogs (I had quite learned to
understand their croaking by this time).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>dagger</i>!&rdquo; Sylvie proclaimed in a
peremptory tone. &ldquo;Hold your tongues!&rdquo; And
the croaking ceased at once.</p>
<p>Shakespeare has not told us, so far as I
know, that Macbeth had any such eccentric
habit as turning head-over-heels in private
life: but Bruno evidently considered it quite
an essential part of the character, and left the
stage in a series of somersaults. However,
he was back again in a few moments, having
tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of
wool (probably left on the thorn by a wandering
sheep), which made a magnificent beard,
that reached nearly down to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shylock!&rdquo; Sylvie proclaimed. &ldquo;No, I beg
your pardon!&rdquo; she hastily corrected herself,
&ldquo;King Lear! I hadn&rsquo;t noticed the crown.&rdquo;
(Bruno had very cleverly provided one, which
fitted him exactly, by cutting out the centre
of a dandelion to make room for his head.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_372">372</div>
<p>King Lear folded his arms (to the imminent
peril of his beard) and said, in a mild explanatory
tone, &ldquo;Ay, every <i>inch</i> a king!&rdquo; and then
paused, as if to consider how this could best be
proved. And here, with all possible deference
to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic, I <i>must</i>
express my opinion that the poet did <i>not</i> mean
his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely
alike in their personal habits; nor do I believe
that he would have accepted the faculty of
turning head-over-heels as any proof at all of
royal descent. Yet it appeared that King
Lear, after deep meditation, could think of no
other argument by which to prove his kingship:
and, as this was the last of the &lsquo;Bits&rsquo; of
Shakespeare (&ldquo;We never do more than <i>three</i>,&rdquo;
Sylvie explained in a whisper), Bruno gave the
audience quite a long series of somersaults
before he finally retired, leaving the enraptured
Frogs all crying out &ldquo;More! More!&rdquo; which I
suppose was their way of encoring a performance.
But Bruno wouldn&rsquo;t appear again, till
the proper time came for telling the Story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_373">373</div>

<p class="center small">THE FROGS&rsquo; BIRTHDAY-TREAT</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
<p>When he appeared at last in his <i>real</i> character,
I noticed a remarkable change in his behaviour.
He tried no more somersaults. It was clearly
his opinion that, however suitable the habit of
turning head-over-heels might be to such petty
individuals as Hamlet and King Lear, it would
never do for <i>Bruno</i> to sacrifice his dignity to
such an extent. But it was equally clear that
he did not feel entirely at his ease, standing all
alone on the stage, with no costume to disguise
him: and though he began, several times,
&ldquo;There were a Mouse&mdash;,&rdquo; he kept glancing
up and down, and on all sides, as if in search of
more comfortable quarters from which to tell
the Story. Standing on one side of the stage,
and partly overshadowing it, was a tall fox-glove,
which seemed, as the evening breeze
gently swayed it hither and thither, to offer
exactly the sort of accommodation that the
orator desired. Having once decided on his
quarters, it needed only a second or two for
him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel, and
to seat himself astride on the topmost bend,
where the fairy-bells clustered most closely,
and from whence he could look down on his
audience from such a height that all shyness
vanished, and he began his Story merrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_375">375</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile
and a Man and a Goat and a Lion.&rdquo; I had
never heard the &lsquo;dramatis person&aelig;&rsquo; tumbled
into a story with such profusion and in such
reckless haste; and it fairly took my breath
away. Even Sylvie gave a little gasp, and
allowed three of the Frogs, who seemed to be
getting tired of the entertainment, to hop
away into the ditch, without attempting to
stop them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Mouse found a Shoe, and it thought
it were a Mouse-trap. So it got right in, and it
stayed in ever so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did it <i>stay</i> in?&rdquo; said Sylvie. Her
function seemed to be much the same as that
of the Chorus in a Greek Play: she had to
encourage the orator, and draw him out, by a
series of intelligent questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause it thought it couldn&rsquo;t get out again,&rdquo;
Bruno explained. &ldquo;It were a clever mouse.
It knew it couldn&rsquo;t get out of traps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did it go in at all?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and it jamp, and it jamp,&rdquo; Bruno proceeded,
ignoring this question, &ldquo;and at last it
got right out again. And it looked at the mark
<span class="pb" id="Page_376">376</span>
in the Shoe. And the Man&rsquo;s name were in it.
So it knew it wasn&rsquo;t its own Shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it thought it <i>was</i>?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t I tell oo it thought it were a
<i>Mouse-trap</i>?&rdquo; the indignant orator replied.
&ldquo;Please, Mister Sir, will oo make Sylvie attend?&rdquo;
Sylvie was silenced, and was all attention:
in fact, she and I were most of the audience
now, as the Frogs kept hopping away,
and there were very few of them left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Mouse gave the Man his Shoe.
And the Man were welly glad, &rsquo;cause he hadn&rsquo;t
got but one Shoe, and he were hopping to get
the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I ventured on a question. &ldquo;Do you
mean &lsquo;hopping,&rsquo; or &lsquo;hoping&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bofe,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;And the Man took
the Goat out of the Sack.&rdquo; (&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard
of the <i>sack</i> before,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Nor you won&rsquo;t
hear of it again,&rdquo; said Bruno). &ldquo;And he said
to the Goat, &lsquo;Oo will walk about here till I
comes back.&rsquo; And he went and he tumbled
into a deep hole. And the Goat walked round
and round. And it walked under the Tree.
And it wug its tail. And it looked up in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_377">377</span>
Tree. And it sang a sad little Song. Oo
never heard such a sad little Song!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you sing it, Bruno?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iss, I can,&rdquo; Bruno readily replied. &ldquo;And
I sa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. It would make Sylvie cry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sylvie interrupted in great
indignation. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe the Goat
sang it at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did, though!&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;It singed
it right froo. I <i>sawed</i> it singing with its
long beard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t sing with its <i>beard</i>,&rdquo; I said,
hoping to puzzle the little fellow: &ldquo;a beard
isn&rsquo;t a <i>voice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, <i>oo</i> couldn&rsquo;t walk with Sylvie!&rdquo;
Bruno cried triumphantly. &ldquo;Sylvie isn&rsquo;t a
<i>foot</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought I had better follow Sylvie&rsquo;s example,
and be silent for a while. Bruno was
too sharp for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when it had singed all the Song, it
ran away&mdash;for to get along to look for the
Man, oo know. And the Crocodile got along
after it&mdash;for to bite it, oo know. And the
Mouse got along after the Crocodile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_378">378</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the Crocodile <i>running</i>?&rdquo; Sylvie
enquired. She appealed to me. &ldquo;Crocodiles
do run, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suggested &ldquo;crawling&rdquo; as the proper word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t running,&rdquo; said Bruno, &ldquo;and he
wasn&rsquo;t crawling. He went struggling along like
a portmanteau. And he held his chin ever so
high in the air&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do <i>that</i> for?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause he hadn&rsquo;t got a toofache!&rdquo; said
Bruno. &ldquo;Ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t oo make out <i>nuffin</i> wizout I
&rsquo;splain it? Why, if he&rsquo;d had a toofache, a
course he&rsquo;d have held his head down&mdash;like
this&mdash;and he&rsquo;d have put a lot of warm
blankets round it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d <i>had</i> any blankets,&rdquo; Sylvie argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course he <i>had</i> blankets!&rdquo; retorted her
brother. &ldquo;Doos oo think Crocodiles goes
walks wizout blankets? And he frowned with
his eyebrows. And the Goat was welly
flightened at his eyebrows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never be afraid of <i>eyebrows</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think oo <i>would</i>, though, if they&rsquo;d
got a Crocodile fastened to them, like these
<span class="pb" id="Page_379">379</span>
had! And so the Man jamp, and he jamp,
and at last he got right out of the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sylvie gave another little gasp: this rapid
dodging about among the characters of the
Story had taken away her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he runned away&mdash;for to look for the
Goat, oo know. And he heard the Lion
grunting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lions don&rsquo;t grunt,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one did,&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;And its
mouth were like a large cupboard. And it had
plenty of room in its mouth. And the Lion
runned after the Man&mdash;for to eat him, oo know.
And the Mouse runned after the Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Mouse was running after the
<i>Crocodile</i>,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t run after
<i>both</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno sighed over the density of his audience,
but explained very patiently. &ldquo;He <i>did</i>
runned after <i>bofe</i>: &rsquo;cause they went the same
way! And first he caught the Crocodile, and
then he didn&rsquo;t catch the Lion. And when he&rsquo;d
caught the Crocodile, what doos oo think he did&mdash;&rsquo;cause
he&rsquo;d got pincers in his pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ca&rsquo;n&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_380">380</div>
<div class="img" id="fig46">
<img src="images/i380.jpg" alt="&lsquo;HE WRENCHED OUT THAT CROCODILE&rsquo;S TOOF!&rsquo;" width="500" height="486" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;HE WRENCHED OUT THAT CROCODILE&rsquo;S TOOF!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody couldn&rsquo;t guess it!&rdquo; Bruno cried in
high glee. &ldquo;Why, he wrenched out that
Crocodile&rsquo;s toof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Which</i> tooth?&rdquo; I ventured to ask.</p>
<p>But Bruno was not to be puzzled. &ldquo;The
toof he were going to bite the Goat with, a
course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be sure about that,&rdquo; I argued,
&ldquo;unless he wrenched out <i>all</i> its teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_381">381</div>
<p>Bruno laughed merrily, and half sang, as he
swung himself backwards and forwards, &ldquo;He
did&mdash;wrenched&mdash;out&mdash;<i>all</i> its teef!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did the Crocodile wait to have them
wrenched out?&rdquo; said Sylvie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had to wait,&rdquo; said Bruno.</p>
<p>I ventured on another question. &ldquo;But what
became of the Man who said &lsquo;You may wait
here till I come back&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Oo <i>may</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; Bruno explained.
&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Oo <i>will</i>.&rsquo; Just like Sylvie says to
me &lsquo;Oo will do oor lessons till twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;
Oh, I <i>wiss</i>,&rdquo; he added with a little sigh,
&ldquo;I <i>wiss</i> Sylvie would say &lsquo;Oo <i>may</i> do oor
lessons&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a dangerous subject for discussion,
Sylvie seemed to think. She returned to the
Story. &ldquo;But what became of the Man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Lion springed at him. But it
came so slow, it were three weeks in the
air&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Man wait for it all that time?&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Bruno replied, gliding
head-first down the stem of the fox-glove, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_382">382</span>
the Story was evidently close to its end. &ldquo;He
sold his house, and he packed up his things,
while the Lion were coming. And he went
and he lived in another town. So the Lion ate
the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was evidently the Moral: so Sylvie
made her final proclamation to the Frogs.
&ldquo;The Story&rsquo;s finished! And whatever is to be
<i>learned</i> from it,&rdquo; she added, aside to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not feel <i>quite</i> clear about it myself, so
made no suggestion: but the Frogs seemed
quite content, Moral or no Moral, and merely
raised a husky chorus of &ldquo;Off! Off!&rdquo; as they
hopped away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_383">383</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">LOOKING EASTWARD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a week,&rdquo; I said, three days later,
to Arthur, &ldquo;since we heard of Lady Muriel&rsquo;s
engagement. I think <i>I</i> ought to call, at any
rate, and offer my congratulations. Won&rsquo;t
you come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pained expression passed over his face.
&ldquo;When must you leave us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the first train on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I <i>will</i> come with you. It
would seem strange and unfriendly if I didn&rsquo;t.
But this is only Friday. Give me till Sunday
afternoon. I shall be stronger then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_384">384</div>
<p>Shading his eyes with one hand, as if half-ashamed
of the tears that were coursing down
his cheeks, he held the other out to me. It
trembled as I clasped it.</p>
<p>I tried to frame some words of sympathy;
but they seemed poor and cold, and I left them
unspoken. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; was all I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, dear friend!&rdquo; he replied.
There was a manly vigour in his tone that
convinced me he was wrestling with, and
triumphing over, the great sorrow that had
so nearly wrecked his life&mdash;and that, on the
stepping-stone of his dead self, he would
surely rise to higher things!</p>
<p>There was no chance, I was glad to think,
as we set out on Sunday afternoon, of meeting
<i>Eric</i> at the Hall, as he had returned to town
the day after his engagement was announced.
<i>His</i> presence might have disturbed the calm&mdash;the
almost unnatural calm&mdash;with which Arthur
met the woman who had won his heart, and
murmured the few graceful words of sympathy
that the occasion demanded.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel was perfectly radiant with
happiness: sadness could not live in the light
<span class="pb" id="Page_385">385</span>
of such a smile: and even Arthur brightened
under it, and, when she remarked &ldquo;You see
I&rsquo;m watering my flowers, though it <i>is</i> the
Sabbath-Day,&rdquo; his voice had almost its old ring
of cheerfulness as he replied &ldquo;Even on the
Sabbath-Day works of mercy are allowed.
But this <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> the Sabbath-Day. The Sabbath-Day
has ceased to exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not <i>Saturday</i>,&rdquo; Lady Muriel
replied: &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t Sunday often called &lsquo;the
Christian Sabbath&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so called, I think, in recognition of
the <i>spirit</i> of the Jewish institution, that one day
in seven should be a day of <i>rest</i>. But I hold
that Christians are freed from the <i>literal</i> observance
of the Fourth Commandment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is our <i>authority</i> for Sunday
observance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have, first, the fact that the seventh
day was &lsquo;sanctified&rsquo;, when God rested from the
work of Creation. That is binding on us as
<i>Theists</i>. Secondly, we have the fact that &lsquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s Day&rsquo; is a <i>Christian</i> institution. That
is binding on us as <i>Christians</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your practical rules would be&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
<p>&ldquo;First, as Theists, to keep it <i>holy</i> in some
special way, and to make it, so far as is
reasonably possible, a day of <i>rest</i>. Secondly,
as <i>Christians</i>, to attend public worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of <i>amusements</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say of them, as of all kinds of
<i>work</i>, whatever is innocent on a week-day, is
innocent on Sunday, provided it does not interfere
with the duties of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you would allow children to <i>play</i> on
Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I should. Why make the day
irksome to their restless natures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a letter somewhere,&rdquo; said Lady
Muriel, &ldquo;from an old friend, describing the way
in which Sunday was kept in her younger days.
I will fetch it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a similar description, <i>viv&acirc; voce</i>, years
ago,&rdquo; Arthur said when she had left us, &ldquo;from
a little girl. It was really touching to hear the
melancholy tone in which she said &lsquo;On Sunday
I mustn&rsquo;t play with my doll! On Sunday I
mustn&rsquo;t run on the sands! On Sunday I mustn&rsquo;t
dig in the garden!&rsquo; Poor child! She had indeed
abundant cause for hating Sunday!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_387">387</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the letter,&rdquo; said Lady Muriel, returning.
&ldquo;Let me read you a piece of it.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>When, as a child, I first opened my eyes
on a Sunday-morning, a feeling of dismal anticipation,
which began at least on the Friday,
culminated. I knew what was before me, and
my wish, if not my word, was &lsquo;Would God
it were evening!&rsquo; It was no day of rest,
but a day of texts, of catechisms (Watts&rsquo;), of
tracts about converted swearers, godly char-women,
and edifying deaths of sinners saved.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Up with the lark, hymns and portions of
Scripture had to be learned by heart till 8
o&rsquo;clock, when there were family-prayers, then
breakfast, which I was never able to enjoy, partly
from the fast already undergone, and partly
from the outlook I dreaded.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>At 9 came Sunday-School; and it made
me indignant to be put into the class with the
village-children, as well as alarmed lest, by some
mistake of mine, I should be put below them.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Church-Service was a veritable Wilderness
of Zin. I wandered in it, pitching the
tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_388">388</span>
square family-pew, the fidgets of my small
brothers, and the horror of knowing that, on
the Monday, I should have to write out, from
memory, jottings of the rambling disconnected
extempore sermon, which might have had any
text but its own, and to stand or fall by the
result.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This was followed by a cold dinner at 1</i>
(<i>servants to have</i> no <i>work</i>), <i>Sunday-School again
from 2 to 4, and Evening-Service at 6. The
intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all,
from the efforts I had to make, to be less than
usually sinful, by reading books and sermons as
barren as the Dead Sea. There was but one
rosy spot, in the distance, all that day: that
was &lsquo;bed-time,&rsquo; which never could come too
early!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Such teaching was well meant, no doubt,&rdquo;
said Arthur; &ldquo;but it must have driven many of
its victims into deserting the Church-Services
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid <i>I</i> was a deserter this morning,&rdquo;
she gravely said. &ldquo;I had to write to Eric.
Would you&mdash;would you mind my telling you
<span class="pb" id="Page_389">389</span>
something he said about <i>prayer</i>? It had never
struck me in that light before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what light?&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that all Nature goes by fixed, regular
laws&mdash;Science has proved <i>that</i>. So that asking
God to <i>do</i> anything (except of course praying
for <i>spiritual</i> blessings) is to expect a miracle:
and we&rsquo;ve no right to do <i>that</i>. I&rsquo;ve not put it
as well as <i>he</i> did: but that was the outcome of
it, and it has confused me. Please tell me what
you can say in answer to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose to discuss <i>Captain Lindon&rsquo;s</i>
difficulties,&rdquo; Arthur gravely replied; &ldquo;specially
as he is not present. But, if it is <i>your</i> difficulty,&rdquo;
(his voice unconsciously took a tenderer
tone) &ldquo;then I will speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> my difficulty,&rdquo; she said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will begin by asking &lsquo;Why did you
except <i>spiritual</i> blessings?&rsquo; Is not your mind
a part of Nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Free-Will comes in there&mdash;I can
<i>choose</i> this or that; and God can influence my
choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are not a Fatalist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she earnestly exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_390">390</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Arthur said to himself, but
in so low a whisper that only <i>I</i> heard it. &ldquo;You
grant then that I can, by an act of free choice,
move this cup,&rdquo; suiting the action to the word,
&ldquo;<i>this</i> way or <i>that</i> way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us see how far the result is produced
by fixed laws. The <i>cup</i> moves because
certain mechanical forces are impressed on it
by my <i>hand</i>. My <i>hand</i> moves because certain
forces&mdash;electric, magnetic, or whatever &lsquo;nerve-force&rsquo;
may prove to be&mdash;are impressed on it
by my <i>brain</i>. This nerve-force, stored in the
brain, would probably be traceable, if Science
were complete, to chemical forces supplied to
the brain by the blood, and ultimately derived
from the food I eat and the air I breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would not that be Fatalism? Where
would Free-Will come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>choice</i> of nerves,&rdquo; replied Arthur. &ldquo;The
nerve-force in the brain may flow just as naturally
down one nerve as down another. We
need something more than a fixed Law of
Nature to settle <i>which</i> nerve shall carry it.
That &lsquo;something&rsquo; is Free-Will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
<p>Her eyes sparkled. &ldquo;I see what you mean!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Human Free-Will is an exception
to the system of fixed Law. Eric said
something like that. And then I think he
pointed out that God can only influence Nature
by influencing Human Wills. So that we <i>might</i>
reasonably pray &lsquo;<i>give us this day our daily
bread</i>,&rsquo; because many of the causes that produce
bread are under Man&rsquo;s control. But to pray
for rain, or fine weather, would be as unreasonable
as&mdash;&rdquo; she checked herself, as if fearful of
saying something irreverent.</p>
<p>In a hushed, low tone, that trembled with
emotion, and with the solemnity of one in the
presence of death, Arthur slowly replied &ldquo;<i>Shall
he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct
him?</i> Shall we, &lsquo;the swarm that in the noontide
beam were born,&rsquo; feeling in ourselves the
power to direct, this way or that, the forces of
Nature&mdash;of <i>Nature</i>, of which we form so
trivial a part&mdash;shall we, in our boundless arrogance,
in our pitiful conceit, <i>deny</i> that power to
the Ancient of Days? Saying, to our Creator,
&lsquo;Thus far and no further. Thou madest, but
thou canst not rule!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_392">392</div>
<p>Lady Muriel had covered her face in her
hands, and did not look up. She only murmured
&ldquo;Thanks, thanks!&rdquo; again and again.</p>
<p>We rose to go. Arthur said, with evident
effort, &ldquo;One word more. If you would <i>know</i>
the power of Prayer&mdash;in anything and everything
that Man can need&mdash;<i>try</i> it. <i>Ask, and
it shall be given you.</i> I&mdash;<i>have</i> tried it. I
<i>know</i> that God answers prayer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our walk home was a silent one, till we
had nearly reached the lodgings: then Arthur
murmured&mdash;and it was almost an echo of my
own thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;<i>What knowest thou, O wife,
whether thou shalt save thy husband?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject was not touched on again. We
sat on, talking, while hour after hour, of this
our last night together, glided away unnoticed.
He had much to tell me about India, and
the new life he was going to, and the <i>work</i>
he hoped to do. And his great generous soul
seemed so filled with noble ambition as to have
no space left for any vain regret or selfish
repining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, it is nearly morning!&rdquo; Arthur said
at last, rising and leading the way upstairs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_393">393</span>
&ldquo;The sun will be rising in a few minutes:
and, though I <i>have</i> basely defrauded you of
your last chance of a night&rsquo;s rest here, I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ll forgive me: for I really <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
bring myself to say &lsquo;Good night&rsquo; sooner. And
God knows whether you&rsquo;ll ever see me again,
or hear of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hear</i> of you I am certain I shall!&rdquo; I
warmly responded, and quoted the concluding
lines of that strange poem &lsquo;Waring&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t7">&ldquo;Oh, never star</p>
<p class="t0">Was lost here, but it rose afar!</p>
<p class="t0">Look East, where whole new thousands are!</p>
<p class="t0">In Vishnu-land what Avatar?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, look Eastward!&rdquo; Arthur eagerly replied,
pausing at the stair-case window, which
commanded a fine view of the sea and the
eastward horizon. &ldquo;The West is the fitting
tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing, all the
errors and the follies of the Past: for all its
withered Hopes and all its buried Loves!
From the East comes new strength, new ambition,
new Hope, new Life, new Love! Look
Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_394">394</div>
<p>His last words were still ringing in my ears
as I entered my room, and undrew the window-curtains,
just in time to see the sun burst in
glory from his ocean-prison, and clothe the
world in the light of a new day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So may it be for him, and me, and all of
us!&rdquo; I mused. &ldquo;All that is evil, and dead,
and hopeless, fading with the Night that is
past! All that is good, and living, and hopeful,
rising with the dawn of Day!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fading, with the Night, the chilly mists,
and the noxious vapours, and the heavy shadows,
and the wailing gusts, and the owl&rsquo;s melancholy
hootings: rising, with the Day, the darting
shafts of light, and the wholesome morning
breeze, and the warmth of a dawning life,
and the mad music of the lark! Look
Eastward!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fading, with the Night, the clouds of
ignorance, and the deadly blight of sin, and
the silent tears of sorrow: and ever rising,
higher, higher, with the Day, the radiant dawn
of knowledge, and the sweet breath of purity,
and the throb of a world&rsquo;s ecstasy! Look
Eastward!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_395">395</div>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/i395.jpg" alt="&lsquo;LOOK EASTWARD!&rsquo;" width="500" height="377" />
<p class="center small">&lsquo;LOOK EASTWARD!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fading, with the Night, the memory of
a dead love, and the withered leaves of a
blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and
moody regrets that numb the best energies of
the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling upward
like a living flood, the manly resolve, and
the dauntless will, and the heavenward gaze
of faith&mdash;<i>the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!&rdquo;</p>
